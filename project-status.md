## 2026-05-23 - 16:00 — F26 adopted: exact rotation-law EM propagator implemented (3D BCC + 2D square)

Finding 26 reframes $c_\text{lat}$ as the angular rotation rate of the $(E, B)$ pair per unit wavenumber, not a phase-propagation speed. The exact discrete EM law is a rigid real rotation in Fourier space; Maxwell's curl equations are its first-order Taylor expansion.

**Changes:**
- `ca_maxwell.py`: module docstring restructured (rotation PRIMARY, Maxwell DERIVED); 4 new functions: `rotation_omega_bcc`, `rotation_step_em_spectral`, `c_from_rotation_rate`, `rotation_law_consistency`.
- `ca_maxwell_2d.py`: matching 4 new functions for the 2D square QCA using `exact2d_dispersion`.
- `roadmap-f26-rotation.md`: new roadmap document with Phases 1–5 for full F26 adoption.
- `exactness-inventory.md`: 2 new Tier-1 entries (c_lat from rotation rate; count → 61) and 2 new Tier-2 entries (full-lattice rotation law at machine precision).

**Confirmed numbers:**
- 3D BCC: $c_\text{lat} = 1/\sqrt{3}$, residual $< 10^{-7}$; rotation law residual $2.8\times 10^{-16}$; Maxwell curl $2.0\times 10^{-2}$ at $k=0.05$.
- 2D square: $c_\text{lat} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, residual $2.93\times 10^{-8}$; rotation law residual $2.2\times 10^{-15}$; Maxwell curl $1.8\times 10^{-2}$ at $k=0.05$.

The $O(k)$ curl residual (Finding 2) is now understood as the linearisation error of the exact rotation and is closed as an open problem.

## 2026-05-23 - 14:00 — SU(2) complex-mass merged into ca_dirac.py

The F27 fork (`forks/complex_mass_fork.py`) has been merged into the main model as a new section in `ca-simulation/ca_dirac.py`. The test file `model-tests/test_complex_mass_chiral.py` now imports directly from `ca_dirac`; 9/9 tests pass with identical residuals to the fork run.

New public API: `dirac_step_complex_mass_1flavor`, `dirac_step_complex_mass_doublet`, `mass_step_1flavor_u1`, `mass_step_doublet_su2`, `su2_gauge_transform_chiral`, `make_su2_field`, `gaussian_doublet`, `norm_doublet`, `chirality_split_doublet`, `isospin_t3_doublet`, `su2_casimir_left`. All existing steppers unchanged.

## 2026-05-23 - 12:00 — F27: Chiral SU(2) from β-gauging confirmed; Higgs-free mass coupling (Ludwig 2007)

Implemented Ludwig's complex-mass proposal (physics_notes_0708.pdf pages 59–60) as a CA fork and ran a 9-test suite. All 9 tests pass (1.02 s total).

**Central result:** the Ward identity

$$V(x)\cdot\mathrm{mass\_step}(\psi;\,U) = \mathrm{mass\_step}(V(x)\cdot\psi;\;V(x)\cdot U)$$

holds to $1.055\times 10^{-17}$ (machine precision), where $V(x)\in\mathrm{SU}(2)$ acts only on the left-handed $\eta$ sector — the right-handed $\chi$ is identically unchanged. This is local SU(2)_L gauge invariance of the complex-mass coupling without a Higgs field.

Additional confirmed results:
- $U(x)$ steers isospin coupling (Higgs VEV direction job) but is pure gauge — not a physical boson
- Mass gap exists without scalar condensate ($N_R = 0.820$ after 80 steps with $U=I$)
- $\langle T_3\rangle = +\tfrac{1}{2}$ for $\nu_L$ ($1.110\times 10^{-16}$)
- $\theta(x)$ is pure gauge: dispersion is exactly $\theta$-independent ($3.331\times 10^{-16}$)
- Chiral selectivity: $\chi$ exactly unchanged by SU(2)_L ($0.000$, exact zero)

Known limitation: kinetic step requires $W_\mu$ bosons for full local SU(2) invariance (same as SM — not a defect).

## 2026-05-23 — C9 / F26: BCC spin axis derived in closed form; scalar contamination locked down

Derived the BCC spin axis $\hat{n}(\hat{k})$ in closed form and proved the identity $|\psi^T\psi|^2 = 1 - \hat{n}_y(\hat{k})^2$,
completely eliminating the free parameter in the (1,0) bilinear scalar contamination from F24.

**Key result:**

$$G'^i - \Lambda_{(1,0)}^{ij}G^j = -\sinh\zeta\;\hat{v}^i\,(\psi^T\psi), \qquad |\psi^T\psi| = \sqrt{1 - \hat{n}_y(\hat{k})^2}$$

where $\hat{n}(\hat{k})$ is the exact BCC spin axis from `bcc_spin_axis`.  Continuum limit: $|\psi^T\psi| \to \sqrt{1 - \hat{k}_y^2}$.

**Implementation:**
- `ca_bcc.py::bcc_spin_axis` — closed-form $\hat{n}(k)$, vectorised, numerically safe at $|k|=0$
- `ca_maxwell.py::psi_scalar_bilinear_analytic` — stable Bloch-angle form (arccos/arctan2); rational form dropped (unstable near south pole)
- `ca_maxwell.py::weyl_spin_axis_scalar_contamination` — two-track C9 verification

**Numerical results (12 directions, $k = 0.3$):**

| Track | Method | Residual |
|---|---|---|
| A | Algebraic identity $\|f\|^2 + \hat{n}_y^2 = 1$ | $2.84 \times 10^{-14}$ |
| B | vs. `np.linalg.eig` eigenmode | $6.20 \times 10^{-14}$ |

Finding: F26. Code: `ca_bcc.py::bcc_spin_axis`, `ca_maxwell.py::psi_scalar_bilinear_analytic`.
Exactness entry: Tier 1 #52 (53 total exact results).

## 2026-05-23 — F26: Speed of light reinterpreted as angular rotation rate of the (E, B) pair

Derived conceptually from F25.  $c_\text{lat}$ is not the propagation rate of a complex phase — it is
the angular rotation rate of the $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{B})$ vector pair per unit wavenumber:
$c_\text{lat} = d\Omega/d|\mathbf{k}|$ at $|\mathbf{k}|\to 0$.

Consequences documented:
1. **Maxwell's equations are the linearization** of the exact cosine/sine rotation ($\Delta t \to 0$ limit).
2. **The imaginary unit** $i$ in Maxwell/QFT is the real-matrix representation of the $(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$-plane rotation generator $J$, recovered by Taylor-expanding $\cos\Omega \approx 1$, $\sin\Omega \approx \Omega$.
3. **Energy conservation is geometric** — the rotation preserves $\|\mathbf{E}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{B}\|^2$ as a consequence of Pythagoras, not dynamics.
4. **The O(k) curl residual** (originally Finding 2) is the $O(\Omega^2)$ linearization error of the rotation, with coefficient $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2}$ algebraically forced — a structural prediction, not an open problem.
5. **Falsifiable at Planck scale**: exact rotation and Maxwell linearization diverge by $-\Omega^2/6$ in phase velocity at $\Omega \sim \pi/2$.

Finding: F26 (`findings/F26-speed-of-light-as-rotation-rate.md`).

## 2026-05-23 — C8 / F25: Real-rotation formula holds to machine precision; Maxwell curl holds only to O(k)

Added `real_rotation_vs_maxwell_curl()` and `real_rotation_k_scan()` to `ca-simulation/ca_maxwell.py`
(Section C8).  The test directly answers: *If the Maxwell curl equation is wrong at Planck scale and
$c_\text{lat}$ is correct, what is the impact?*

The composite-photon bilinear evolves as $G_T(t) = e^{-i\Omega t}G_T(0)$, giving the exact discrete
real-rotation formula:

$$E(t+1) = \cos\Omega\;E(t) + \sin\Omega\;B(t), \qquad B(t+1) = -\sin\Omega\;E(t) + \cos\Omega\;B(t)$$

with $\Omega = 2\omega(k/2)$.  This identity holds for any $\Omega$ and any initial state — no
small-$k$ approximation required.

**Numerical results (12 random BCC directions, $k = 0.05$):**

| Prediction | E residual | B residual |
|---|---|---|
| Real-rotation (cos/sin) | $2.0 \times 10^{-16}$ | $3.3 \times 10^{-16}$ |
| Maxwell curl $E + i(2n)\times B$ | $2.0 \times 10^{-2}$ | $2.0 \times 10^{-2}$ |

**k-scan:** curl\_E/k → $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2} = 0.408248$ (flat); rot\_E/k → 0 at all k (noise only).

**Physical conclusion:** Maxwell's curl equations are the $\Delta t \to 0$ limit of the real-rotation
law.  The $O(k)$ curl residual (F2, F21, F23) is reframed as a confirmed Planck-scale prediction —
its coefficient $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2}$ is the leading signature of the discrete time step at $\Delta t = 1$.

Finding: F25. Code: `ca_maxwell.py::real_rotation_vs_maxwell_curl` and `real_rotation_k_scan`.
Exactness entries: Tier 1 #51 (real-rotation exact), Tier 2 #15 (k-scan O(k) slope).

## 2026-05-23 — C7 / F24: Weyl SL(2,ℂ) boost — 4-current Lorentz covariance at machine precision

Rewrote Section C7 of `ca_maxwell.py`.  The original test `weyl_sl2c_boost_vs_v6` compared
the Paper 1 bilinear $G = \psi^T\sigma\psi$ (transpose, self-dual **(1,0)** rep) against
Mohr's V6 boost (**(½,½)** rep) — these are different Lorentz irreps, making the test ill-posed.

Replaced with `weyl_sl2c_4current_covariance`: for each of 12 random $({\hat k},{\hat v})$ pairs,
computes the Weyl 4-current $j^\mu = (\psi^\dagger\psi,\psi^\dagger\boldsymbol\sigma\psi)$,
boosts it via $\Lambda$ (4×4 SO(1,3) matrix) and via $A\in\text{SL(2,ℂ)}$ independently,
and checks $j'^\mu = \Lambda^\mu{}_\nu j^\nu$.  Result: **3.71×10⁻¹⁶** (machine precision).

Key identity confirmed: $A^\dagger\sigma_z A = \cosh\zeta\,\sigma_z - \sinh\zeta\,I_2$, which
directly gives the correct 4-vector transformation for the $z$-component.

Finding: F24. Code: `ca_maxwell.py::weyl_sl2c_4current_covariance`. Exactness entry: #50.

## 2026-05-23 — F23: Smearing ruled out; curl residual is phase-locked at c_lat/√2

Implemented `ca-simulation/forks/smearing_fork_harness.py` testing Bisio et al. Paper 1's
smearing function f_k(q) as a fix for the O(k) curl residual.  Three smearing classes tested:
(a) fixed-width Gaussian σ ∈ {0.005…0.1}; (b) k-proportional Gaussian σ = α|k|/2 with
α ∈ {0.25…2}; (c) 8-point BCC-shell δ ∈ {0.01…0.1}.  Result: **Smearing Hypothesis (H1)
is ruled out.**  All variants maintain log-log slope 1.0 and coefficient ≈ c_lat/√2.
Fixed-width smearing makes the residual dramatically worse (up to 241×).

Analytic diagnosis: the O(k) residual is a π/2 phase lock between (a) dE = E(t+1)−E(t), which
is REAL at O(k²), and (b) the Paper 1 continuous RHS i(2n)×B, which is IMAGINARY at O(k²).
Coefficient c_lat/√2 is algebraically exact: √2 × c_lat²|k|² / (2 c_lat|k|) / |k| = c_lat/√2.
No smearing function can resolve the π/2 phase difference — it comes from the discrete Δt=1
time step, not from any spatial or momentum-space structure.

Primary surviving hypothesis: H3 (discrete-time vs continuous-time).  Next fork: test small-Δt
limit to confirm that curl/|k| → 0 as Δt → 0 (Paper 1 identity exact in continuous time).

Finding: F23. Harness: `ca-simulation/forks/smearing_fork_harness.py`.
Results: `test-results/smearing_fork_results_2026-05-23.json`.

| — | Mohr (2010) *Annals of Physics* reference paper summarised and compared to current composite-photon wave functions. Summary in `reference-research/mohr-2010-maxwell-photon-wf-summary.md`. Key findings: our $E_G, B_G$ bilinear is structurally identical to Mohr's 6-component $\Psi=(E_s, icB_s)^T$; transversality, dispersion, and curl tests already verified. Priority gaps identified: explicit polarization basis $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_\lambda(\hat{\boldsymbol{k}})$, Poynting energy conservation of the bilinear, Lorentz boost covariance test, and longitudinal ($\lambda=0$) mode.

Closes "no closed form extracted" item in Finding 12.

Matches: deterministic CA worldview, two-step time-reversibility, ontological basis, mod-$2\pi/\delta t$ Hamiltonian ambiguity, classical/cat resolution, info-loss ↔ gauge equivalence hypothesis. Differences: lattice geometry (we have BCC uniqueness; CAI is silent), photon construction (we have Paper 1 Eq. 35 composite γ; CAI flags it as open), gravity (we have EMQG Poisson at 0.35% Newtonian / 0.06% Shapiro; CAI is essay-only), Bell/CHSH mechanism (we evolve singlet directly to $|S| = 2\sqrt 2$; CAI proposes superdeterministic three-point correlation). Sole foundational incompatibility: CAI's "single ontological basis element at all times" axiom — we evolve templates directly.

| — | **Poynting energy gap closed (Finding 17).** Verified $\|E_G(t)\|^2 + c^2\|B_G(t)\|^2 = \text{const}$ during composite-photon propagation (Mohr Eq. 55). Max rel dev $4.77\times 10^{-14}$ / 200 steps; per-step rate $1.4\times 10^{-16} \approx \varepsilon_\text{machine}$ at 10 000 steps. Algebraically exact: conservation follows from the bilinear $G_T = \psi_+^T\sigma\psi_+$ being circularly polarized ($\boldsymbol A\cdot\boldsymbol C=0$, $\|\boldsymbol A\|^2=\|\boldsymbol C\|^2$ to machine-$\varepsilon$), which holds for any $c$ including $c_\text{lat}=1/\sqrt 3$.

Results: GR-3 ratio$_{GR}$ Fork A $1.0001\pm2.3\times10^{-5}$, Fork B $1.0002\pm6.3\times10^{-5}$ — identical to the L=128/6-orbit run. GR-2 (ratio $\approx1.001$) and GR-1 ($|K|\approx3.87$) unchanged. GR-4 ratio $2.0035$ for both forks over 13 detected perihelia; orbit-to-orbit std $1.74\times10^{-4}$ — no drift, confirming numerical stability at 12 orbits.

When Φ provided: per-cell `m_q(x) = y_q Re Φ(x)` routed through `dirac_step_2d_varm_complex_splitstep` per (flavour, colour). Colour-blind: same mass for all colours of a given flavour. Backward-compatible: scalar path unchanged. V13c.1 uniform-Φ regression: **bit-exact** (`max|Δq| = 0.000e+00`). V13c.2 charge conservation, varying Φ: `max|ΔQ^a| = 1.78e−14` over 50 steps (tol 5e−9).

Adopts the **link-variable** lattice-gauge formulation: per-edge SU(3) matrices `U_μ(x)`, Wilson plaquette, three flavours (u, d, s) in colour triplet, Strang-composed with existing Dirac/Yukawa/U(1)/SU(2)/Higgs/EMQG steppers. Cold-link limit reduces bit-for-bit to three colour copies of `dirac_step_2d_splitstep`. **6/6 V13 gates pass:** G0 generator algebra (1.1e-16); V13a cold-link regression (**0.0 bit-for-bit**); V13b1 per-cell divergence (3.2e-2, informational — O(k²) centred-difference truncation); V13b2 global Q conservation (3.8e-13 over 200 steps); V13b3 global adjoint rotation `Q^a → V_adj·Q^b` (1.7e-14 abs, 6.6e-16 rel); V13b4 local gauge invariance of `‖q‖` and `Σ Re Tr U_□` (4.3e-14 norm, 4.4e-16 plaquette).

| — | **QCA velocity-addition deformed formula (Finding 22).** Derived algebraically from $\omega = \arccos(\sqrt{1-m^2}\cos(k/\sqrt{2}))$ that the ratio $\rho(m) = m/(\sqrt{1-m^2}\arcsin m)$ links the group and 4-momentum velocities. The SR Lorentz boost acts exactly on the 4-momentum $(ω, k)$, yielding the deformed group-velocity addition formula $u'_\text{QCA} = (u+v)/(1+2\rho^2 uv)$ with LV deviation $\delta u' = 2(1-\rho^2)uv(u+v)/[(1+2\rho^2 uv)(1+2uv)] \approx 8\beta_\text{LV}\cdot uv(u+v)$. Since $\beta_\text{LV} < 0$, QCA predicts **less** velocity addition than SR at finite mass. SR recovered exactly at $m\to 0$. All three symbolic checks: sympy residual = 0. $\rho$ confirmed to machine precision at $k=10^{-6}$, max residual $3.4\times 10^{-14}$ across $m \in [0.05, 0.90]$.

Added to `findings.md` Finding 15, `ca-reference.md`, `next-steps.md` (already present in `exactness-inventory.md`/`derive_beta_LV.py`). Also corrected the stale $\gamma_\text{LV}$ numeric table in Finding 15 (superseded expression, e.g. $-1.110\times10^{-1}$ at $m=0.5$ → derived $-2.815\times10^{-2}$).

## Content Summary (pages 16–30)

- **Page 16:** Matter-field Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}_\eta$, $\mathcal{L}_\chi$ for massless 2-spinors; Sachs eqs. 3.60/3.62 for $q^\mu(x)$ and $\tilde q^\mu(x)$ in Pauli-matrix form.
- **Page 17:** Covariant derivatives $\eta_{;\mu}, \chi_{;\mu}$ and spin connection $\Omega_\rho^{(x)}$ (eq. 3.77/3.79b); concise total Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (-g)^{1/2}\{R + i\eta^+ q^\mu \eta_{;\mu} + i\chi^+ \tilde q^\mu \chi_{;\mu}\}$.
- **Page 18:** Move to Hamiltonian formulation. $T_{00} = \mathcal{H}$, $\;G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}$ implies $\mathcal{H}_{\text{grav}} = G_{00}/8\pi$; Ricci tensor expansion.
- **Page 19:** $\mathcal{H}_E$ written out for non-spinor and spinor Gen. Rel.; need to treat $\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ / $g^{\mu\nu}$ (and $\Omega_\mu$ / $q^\mu$) as independent variables to keep 1st-order derivatives.
- **Page 20:** Matter-field Hamiltonian — issue noted: naïve $\mathcal{H} = (\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \dot\eta)\dot\eta - \mathcal{L} = 0$ for first-order Lagrangians; symmetrized form introduced.
- **Page 21:** Redefine $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ with covariant derivatives so curvature couples to matter; test with scalar field.

- **Pages 24–25:** Apply Euler–Lagrange to $\eta$; arrive at the matter equation $q^\mu \partial_\mu \eta + q^\mu \Omega_\mu \eta = 0$ after using $(-g)^{1/2}_{\;;\mu} = 0$ and $q^\mu_{\;;\mu} = 0$.
- **Pages 26–28:** Variation w.r.t. the spin connection $\Omega_\rho$; long matrix-trace expansion of $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \Omega_{\rho,\nu}$. **Key observation:** the divergence $\big(\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \Omega_{\rho,\nu}\big)_{;\nu}$ appears to vanish — author flags disagreement with Sachs' derivation ("Sachs gets 0 on the LHS … but apparently this doesn't hold!").
- **Page 27 (interjection):** Question on local Lorentz invariance — whether $q^\mu \to \sigma^\mu$ uniquely at a point, or whether multiple $q$'s give the same $g_{\mu\nu}$ (gauge-like ambiguity).
- **Page 29:** Variation w.r.t. $q^\lambda$ — gravitational-field part involving $K^+_{\lambda\rho}\tilde q^\rho$ and the matter current; flagged need for $\widetilde{\Omega^{(\chi)}_\rho} = \Omega_\rho$.

## Content Summary (pages 31–45)

- **Page 31 ("Motivation & Development of the σ-Matrices"):** Derives the σ-matrix algebra from the requirement that $\sigma^\mu\partial_\mu \psi = 0$ reproduce the scalar wave equation; arrives at $(\sigma^0)^2 = 1$, $(\sigma^i)^2 = \pm 1$, and the anticommutator $\sigma^\mu\sigma^\nu + \sigma^\nu\sigma^\mu = 0$ for $\mu \neq \nu$.
- **Page 32 (Question):** Brief check — $g^{\mu\nu}$ being Lorentzian does *not* force $q^\mu = \sigma^\mu$; instead $g^{\mu\nu} = \tfrac{1}{2}(q^\mu \tilde q^\nu + q^\nu \tilde q^\mu)$, with $q^\mu$ and $\tilde q^\mu$ expanded on the σ-basis.
- **Page 33 ("Lagrangian Approach to Sachs Electrogravity"):** Writes the full two-matter-field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (-g)^{1/2}\{R + \tfrac{1}{2}[\,\eta\,\text{terms}\,] + \tfrac{1}{2}[\,\chi\,\text{terms}\,]\}$, defines $\eta_{;\mu}$, $\chi_{;\mu}$, $\Omega_\mu^{(\chi)} = -\Omega_\mu^+$, and gives $R$ and $K_{\mu\nu}$ explicitly.
- **Page 34:** Re-states the Euler–Lagrange equation $(\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \psi_{;\mu})_{;\mu} - \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \psi = 0$ and lists $q^\mu, \Omega_\mu, \eta, \chi$ as the independent field variables. Rest of page blank.
- **Pages 35–39 (CA speculation interjection):** A side-line of thought asking whether spacetime geometry and particle physics could emerge from a cellular automaton. Page 35 frames the idea ("dependence implies neighborhood; rules imply geometry"). Page 36 argues that lattice dimensionality is set by the number of connections per cell. Page 37 discretizes the 2D wave equation but notes it requires *two* time-step memory — solved by going spinor-valued (Dirac reduction). Page 38 writes out the discrete 2-component massless Weyl equation as an explicit nearest-neighbor update rule. Page 39 reports numerical experiments: without the $\tfrac{1}{2}$ factor the simulation blows up to ~11,000 in ~10 steps; with $\tfrac{1}{2}$ it settles at ~120 and "interestingly stabilizes" around $\sim 0.43$, which the author interprets as effectively rescaling the speed of light.
- **Page 40:** Blank (bleed-through only).
- **Pages 41–45 ("Quantum Hierarchy Equations of a Free Scalar Field" — new paper):** A clean re-derivation of pages 1–4 of the notebook. Page 41 sets up the scalar Lagrangian, canonical momentum, and Hamiltonian density (with Goldstein 12-23, 12-50, 12-53, 12-62 citations). Page 42 introduces the Lorentz-invariant measure $\tfrac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k}$ and Fourier transforms (IzZ 3.35). Page 43 reduces $H$ to $k$-space giving the boxed expression $(\ast)$, and lists the canonical commutators (IzZ 3.36) and field expansions (IzZ 3.37a/b). Page 44 is a *failed* first attempt at the operator substitution — entirely crossed out. Page 45 completes the calculation cleanly and arrives at the boxed final form $H = \tfrac{1}{2}\int \omega_k (a_k^+ a_k + a_k a_k^+) \tfrac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k}$, labelled "Ludwig eq. 3".

## Notes / Uncertainties

- A handful of subscripts and exponents in the Hamiltonian Fourier expansion on page 2 are ambiguous in the original handwriting; signs of $(2\pi)$ factors in particular may need a second pass against a reference text on scalar field quantization.
- Equation 6.45 on page 15 has a parenthetical inline note about $\Omega_{\mu;\sigma}$; the exact form is hard to read and was transcribed as best as the handwriting allowed.
- Diagrams on pages 3 and 5 have now been redrawn as SVG in `diagrams/` (see file list below). The redraws are interpretive — they preserve the topology and labels of the original sketches, not the exact handwriting/line texture.
- Pages 16, 26, 28: several index placements on $K_{\mu\nu}$, $\Omega_{\nu,\mu}$ vs $\Omega_{\nu;\mu}$ are ambiguous in handwriting; transcription preserves what's legible. The matrix forms for $q^\mu(x)$ and $\tilde q^\mu(x)$ on page 16 (Sachs 3.60, 3.62) follow the Pauli/Weyl convention seen earlier.
- Page 26 has a small unlabeled spring-and-block sketch at the top — included as a parenthetical note rather than redrawn.
- Page 27 is a marginal "Question" interjection (locally Lorentzian / gauge-like ambiguity of $q^\mu$) — kept inline at the position it appears in the notebook.
- Pages 31–32 use the symbols $\sigma$ and $q$ interchangeably with their "tilde" counterparts; sign conventions on $\tilde\sigma_\nu$ flip in two places in the margin and both forms have been preserved.
- Page 39 contains a numerical observation ($\sim 0.43$ stabilization factor) that is plausibly an artifact of the chosen finite-difference scheme rather than a physical statement; kept as-is per the original.
- Page 44 is mostly crossed out in the original notebook (a failed first pass at the $H$ substitution). It is transcribed for completeness with a marker that it is the false start; page 45 is the clean redo.
- Pages 41–45 substantially overlap with pages 1–4 (the original scalar-field derivation). The newer version is cleaner and adds the Goldstein / Itzykson–Zuber references and the boxed final form labelled "Ludwig eq. 3".

## Content Summary (pages 46–60)

- **Pages 46–49 (notebook pp. 5–8):** Continuation of the "Quantum Hierarchy Equations" paper. Discretization $a_j = a_{k_j}\,d^3k/[(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k]$; Schrödinger equation in occupation-number basis; expansion of $|\psi\rangle$ in number eigenstates with coefficients $C_{n_{-p}\ldots n_p}$; conversion to $\psi_N(k_1\ldots k_N)$ wavefunctions with normalization factor $\sqrt{(\Delta k)^{3N}/\prod 2\omega_{k_j} \cdot N!/\prod n_j!}$. Page 48 absorbs the vacuum energy via $|\psi'\rangle = e^{-iKt}|\psi\rangle$ giving the free-scalar-boson multiparticle equation. Page 49 flags two open issues: (i) the $\omega_k = \sqrt{k^2+m^2}$ operator doesn't easily Fourier-transform back to spacetime; (ii) bosonic symmetry $\psi_N(\ldots k_i \ldots k_j \ldots) = \psi_N(\ldots k_j \ldots k_i \ldots)$ must be enforced separately. Notes that Dirac spinors should make both covariance and the symmetry/antisymmetry questions cleaner.
- **Page 50:** Blank (bleed-through only).
- **Pages 51–56:** A side-derivation exploring the $a^+, a$ algebra carefully. Page 51 writes the Schrödinger equation, defines $a_k^\pm = \tfrac{1}{2}(\phi_{\mp k} \mp i\pi_k/\omega_k)$, and notes that $\Psi$ is a function of the field values $\phi_j$ at each $k_j$ with probability density $P(\phi_j)$. Page 52 verifies the harmonic-oscillator identity $\tfrac{1}{2}(a^+a + a a^+) = N + \tfrac{1}{2}$ then tries to expand $\mathcal H \sim \pi_k\pi_{-k}/\omega^2 - \omega^2 \phi_k \phi_{-k}$ as coupled oscillators in two coordinates, rotating $45°$ to decouple into one positive + one negative harmonic oscillator (associates these with cos/sin modes). Page 53 cites Messiah V.2 pp.586–600 on Bose symmetrization, noting that for a free field the symmetrization is enforced automatically by commuting creation operators. Page 54 introduces $\alpha_p$ creating $\bar\phi_p = (\phi_p + \phi_{-p})/\sqrt2$ and $\beta_q$ creating $\widetilde\phi_q = (\phi_p - \phi_{-p})/\sqrt2$, and shows real-$\phi(x)$ implies $\widetilde\phi_q = 0$. Pages 55–56 rewrite $H$ in $\alpha,\beta$ form, get $H = \tfrac{1}{4}\int \omega_k(\alpha^+\alpha + \alpha\alpha^+ + \beta^+\beta + \beta\beta^+) d^3k/[(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k]$, and ask whether the cross-terms $T = \alpha^+\beta + \alpha\beta^+ + \ldots$ vanish — concluding $T_k = -T_{-k}$ so $\int T_k\, d^3k = 0$.
- **Page 57:** A photocopy / loose printed page inserted into the notebook — a textbook excerpt on the matrix representations of angular momentum operators (Pauli matrices for $j = \tfrac{1}{2}$, $3\times3$ spin-1 matrices, and higher-spin generalizations, eqs. 2.20–2.22b). Not in the author's hand; included for reference only.
- **Page 58:** Verso of the printed page — blank.
- **Pages 59–60 ("Complex mass", dated 9/6/2007):** New entry. Page 59 reminds the reader that the standard Dirac equation comes from $(\vec\alpha\!\cdot\!\vec p\,c + mc^2\beta)^2 = (p^2c^2 + m^2c^4)\mathbb I$ and that the choice of $\vec\alpha, \beta$ is non-unique: e.g. $\beta = (a\sigma_1 + b\sigma_2)\otimes\sigma_0$ with $a^2+b^2 = 1$ works just as well. Page 60 then asks what happens if the representation is *gauged*, $\beta_g = (U\sigma_1 U^+)\otimes\sigma_0$ with $U = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\theta(x)})$ — an $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry broken to $U(1)$. Author notes this symmetry acts on only *one helicity half* of the bispinor in the Weyl representation, and speculates on a connection to the helicity-dependence (and mass-coupling) of the weak interaction.

## Content Summary (pages 61–90)

- **Page 61 ("Weak Interactions"):** Four-point list framing the questions: $W_\pm, Z$ act only on left-handed components, EM boson $A$ acts on the bottom of the doublets, and the $L \leftrightarrow R$ interaction defines mass.
- **Pages 62–66 ("Weinberg-Salam w/o Higgs"):** Author rebuilds the electroweak Lagrangian without a Higgs sector, keeping $\nu_R$ in the right-handed doublet. Introduces $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge fields $\vec W^\mu, W_0^\mu$, derives the rotation to $(Z_\mu, A_\mu)$ with $g'/g = \tan\theta$ and $e = 2g\sin\theta$, recovers $m_Z = m_W/\cos\theta$, and flags an "anomalous" cross-term $m_Z^2 W_{0\mu}W_{3\mu}$.
- **Pages 67–72:** A "new ideas" interjection. Notices that $A_\mu$ acts on the isospin doublet just as $W$ acts on the spin doublet. Proposes a Fermi-like contact Lagrangian $g(\bar\nu_L e_L + \bar e_L \nu_L)$ with kinetic terms gauged by a new $B_\mu$ field that produces neutral currents. Page 70 finds an unwanted factor-of-2 in the combined kinetic Lagrangian, suggesting a quadruplet representation. Pages 71–72 Q-and-A: experimental evidence for $W$ particulation comes from $\mu^- \to e^- + \bar\nu_e + \nu_\mu$; speculates that charge, like spin, may have a "Heisenberg-uncertainty"-style dynamic conservation.
- **Pages 73–74 ("Mass & rotational travel"):** A side-line of thought: model a massive particle as a helical worldline of a light-like trajectory. $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{c^2 - 4\pi^2\nu^2 r^2}$. Page 74 attempts to relate this to the Klein–Gordon dispersion using $p = \gamma m_0 v$; arrives at $v^2 = c^2 - E_0^2/E^2$ which the author dismisses ("Way way — no good").
- **Page 75 ("ASI" — Ferbel Vol 7):** Reference numbers copied from *NATO ASI Series: Techniques & Concepts of HEP* (T. Ferbel, ed.). $m_W = 80.22\,\text{GeV}$, $m_Z = 91.187\,\text{GeV}$, $m_\tau = 1776.9\,\text{MeV}$, $G_F^\tau/G_F^\mu = 0.987$ (a $2.2\sigma$ tension), $\sin^2\theta_W = 0.232$, $m_t = 175 \pm 6\,\text{GeV}$.
- **Page 76:** Majorana mass-matrix block. Neutrino mass bounds (PDG-style) noted side-by-side with the older textbook values. Standard Fermi Lagrangian $\mathcal L_F = -G_F/\sqrt 2\,\bar p\gamma_\lambda n\,\bar e\gamma^\lambda \nu_e$ and the V–A current $J^\mu = \bar\nu_e \gamma_\mu(1-\gamma_5)e + \ldots$. References *The Physics of Massive Neutrinos* by Vannucci (LPNHE Paris 7).
- **Page 77 ("Program for Weak Interaction Physics"):** Restates the program: weak-interaction "mass" violates charge conservation just as Dirac mass violates spin, but spin is rescued by angular-momentum conservation via $J = L + S$. Reference: Greiner *Rel QM* pp. 216–217 on $[J, H] = 0$ in a spherical potential.
- **Page 78 ("Black-body Radiation"):** Short reference block — Bose–Einstein occupancy $\bar n_\omega = 1/(e^{\hbar\omega/kT}-1)$, mode-counting density $dN_\omega$, and visible-light bands (Red 620–750, Green 495–570, Blue 450–495 nm).
- **Pages 79–80:** Sketch of how a massive-gauge-boson theory reduces to a Fermi 4-fermion contact term as $m_W \to \infty$. Then speculates on a 2-point version mediated by a *finite-mass* neutral $B_0$ and on whether $Z$ might be analogous to a "spin-0 photon" that doesn't really exist.
- **Pages 81–88 (technical exercise):** Dirac plane-wave solutions transformed from standard to Weyl representation, looking at electrons travelling along $\hat z$. Page 81 constructs $U_{DW}$. Pages 82–84 push the four basis spinors $u^{1,2}(0), v^{1,2}(0)$ through $U_{DW}$ and the rewritten $\gamma$-matrices, then take $m \to 0$ — finds only 2 of the 4 components survive cleanly and flags a degeneracy. Pages 85–88 redo the calculation with a fresh ansatz $\psi_\pm = A_\pm e^{i(k_0 t - \vec k\cdot\vec x)}$, isolates 4 independent linear equations, and writes out boxed normalized expressions for $\Psi_{RP}$ (6A), $\Psi_{LA}$ (6B), $\Psi_{RA}$ (6C), $\Psi_{LP}$ (6D) — the four chirality/charge-conjugation eigenstates. Notes that the mass term mixes particle↔antiparticle for either handedness but preserves helicity.
- **Pages 89–90:** Builds an EM-↔-weak analogy table laying out all 8 fermion states with their charges $\pm q$ or $\pm g$ and spin/helicity labels. Considers (and rejects on energy grounds) the speculation that the $Z$ might be a $W^+ W^-$ bound state.

### Phase test results (2026-05-14)

| Phase | Description | Key result |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Bloch-sphere spinor coloring | Helicity states render visibly distinct |
| A2 | Visualization frames | 2D strip, 1D spacetime, 8×8 graph view all rendered |
| B1 | Group-velocity measurement | Speed ratios 0.92–0.98 (Gaussian k-spread; → 1 as σ→∞) |
| B2 | Min L / min σ sweeps | L≥32, σ≥3 → free-space behaviour at <0.01% artifact |
| C1 | Variable-c refraction (Strang) | θ_out within 0.51° of Snell; 30% better norm drift than blending |
| D1 | Dirac CA | Weyl regression 5e-16; dispersion 9e-17; norm drift 3e-14 / 1000 steps; zitterbewegung 3.5% off 2mc² (5000-step run) |
| E1 | U(1) Aharonov–Bohm | Phase pickup at machine precision (4e-16); norm exact |
| E2 | SU(2) parity violation | Left rotation exact; right-chirality leak = 0.0 (machine zero) |
| **F1** | **Vacuum regression contract** | **Φ=v fixed at machine precision; fermion matches constant-m reference (8e-16)** |
| **F2** | **Higgs + Goldstone dispersion** | **Radial ω = √(k² + 2μ²) within 0.1%; Goldstone massless within 0.04%** |
| **F3** | **Yukawa back-reaction sketch** | **Φ deflection at fermion density observed (informational; not energy-conserving)** |
| **F4** | **Symmetry-restored phase** | **Φ=0 fixed; η matches pure Weyl reference (8e-16); χ stays zero** |

**Total: 12/12 phases pass.** F1, F4 at machine precision verify the parameter-preservation contract of the unification proposition. F2 verifies both Higgs and Goldstone modes. F3 is a sketch only — a proper symplectic Yukawa back-reaction is a separate engineering task.

### F3 proposition fixes landed (2026-05-15 / 2026-05-16)

- **P4** — `m_eff = y·|Φ|` → `m_eff = y·Re(Φ)`. Resolves the non-analyticity at Φ=0.
- **P2** — Yukawa promoted to complex bilinear `M(x) = y·Φ(x)`. New `dirac_step_2d_varm_complex_splitstep` in `ca_dirac.py`; exactly unitary, reduces bit-for-bit to the real-mass varm stepper when `Im(Φ) ≡ 0`.
- **P1** — Symplectic Yukawa back-reaction via joint Hamiltonian. `unified_step(back_react=True)` Strang-wraps the Dirac step with Π half-kicks `Π −= dt/2·c²·y·χ†η`. The `c²` factor (matching the Dirac stepper's mass-Hamiltonian convention) is essential; without it the Strang split has a constant 1.85% energy offset independent of dt. With it, drift over 200 steps at dt=0.5 is **3 ppm** and scales as O(dt²) exactly. `total_energy(state, mu2, lam, y, c)` helper added. F3 now runs 200 steps without divergence; `max|Φ−v|=4.4e-2` bounded.
- **P3** — Cayley/Crank–Nicolson exact-unitary variable-c stepper in `ca_curved.py`. `CayleyVarcSolver2D` factorises an LU once per c-field change; each subsequent step is one back-substitution. **Norm conservation 5.5e-15** (machine precision) vs **32.6%** drift in the existing Strang stepper — a 6×10¹³ improvement. C1 Snell test gains a Cayley arm; new **F3b** demonstrates Newtonian-gravity-analog deflection: a Weyl probe packet bends 6.6 cells *toward* a static |Φ| depression (norm drift 1.1e-15). Caveat: centered first-difference lattice dispersion makes the Cayley refraction angle 5.4° off Snell at |k|≈0.5; not a bug, the price of position-space exact-unitarity. Higher-order spatial stencils would close it.

**Total 13/13 phases pass** (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1+cayley, D1, E1, E2, F1, F2, F3, F3b, F4). All earlier passes preserved at the same numerical residuals.

### Double-precision regression (2026-05-14)

Fresh run with explicit float64/complex128 (NumPy 2.2.6 default). All 12 phases + the six original Weyl stages re-executed from a clean `__pycache__`. Results compared against the table above:

| Phase / Stage | Prior value | Fresh value | Variation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 group-velocity | 0.92–0.98 | 0.9158 / 0.9172 / 0.9694 / 0.9791 | none (bit-for-bit) |
| B2 norm drift (split-step) | not previously tabulated | 8.8e-16 … 2.2e-14 across L | new data — within 1 ulp per step |
| C1 Snell error | 0.51° | 0.51° | none |
| C1 Strang vs blending norm drift | 30% better | 3.02e-1 vs 4.30e-1 | none |
| D1 Weyl regression | 5e-16 | 5.10e-16 | none |
| D1 norm drift / 1000 steps | 3e-14 | 3.42e-14 | none |
| D1 dispersion residual | 9e-17 | 8.88e-17 | none |
| D1 zitterbewegung | 3.5% / 2mc² | 3.53% / 2mc² | none |
| E1 phase pickup | 4e-16 | 4.44e-16 | none |
| E1 norm drift with A0 | (not recorded) | 3.58e-12 | new data point |
| E2 right-leakage | 0.0 | 0.0 | none |
| F1 Φ−v drift | machine ε | 1.11e-16 | none |
| F1 fermion diff | 8e-16 | 8.41e-16 | none |
| F2 radial dispersion | within 0.1% | max res 1.06e-3 (0.106%) | none |
| F2 goldstone dispersion | within 0.04% | max res 4.42e-4 | none |
| F3 |Φ−v| at center | "observed" | 6.95e-1 (sketch range 0.012–1.247) | first numeric value recorded |
| F4 Φ at 0 | machine ε | 0.0 (exact) | none |
| F4 η match | 8e-16 | 7.57e-16 | none |
| Stage 5 reversibility residual | not tabulated | 1.5e-12 at n=2500 | linear-in-n, 6e-16/step → precision-bound, not a bug |
| Stage 6 3D norm | not tabulated | 150.3449 (constant to 4 dp at t = 0, 1000, 2500, 5000) | conserved |

**Conclusion: no variation.** The codebase is already running at native double precision (NumPy default complex128). Residuals at the 1e-16 level *are* the floor; the only stage that grows away from it is Stage 5, where the residual scales linearly at ~6e-16 per timestep — exactly the per-step round-off budget of a complex128 FFT. Upgrading to `longdouble` (80-bit, ~64-bit mantissa) would shave roughly 1 decimal of error per step but is not worth the slowdown for the current tests.

F3 still passes its informational threshold (`|Φ−v|` is non-trivially nonzero and finite) but the new run captures `max|Φ−v|=6.95e-01` over 30 steps. That is the energy "borrowed from nowhere" by the non-symplectic hand-kick — the magnitude the proposed P1 fix in `ca-f3-propositions.md` needs to bound.

## 2026-05-20 — Full regression at L=192 (post-engine-rebuild)

After the 2026-05-20 21:30 engine rebuild (`ca_fft.py`, `ca_lattice.py`, `ca_propagator.py`), a full sweep of every phase and priority test was re-executed at the maximum resolution permitted by sandbox RAM (~3.4 GB), capped at L=192 in 2D and L=64 in 3D BCC.  New runner scripts: `run_L192_tests.py`, `run_L192_phaseF_tests.py`.  Results JSON in `test-results/phaseAE_L192.json`, `test-results/phaseF_L192.json`.

### SR-2 + Top-10 priority tests

**SR-2 Part A** (algebraic scan, 30 (m, k) pairs):
- Best |Δ| = 5.1e-8 (m=0.5, k=0.001); worst |Δ| = 1.1e-2 (m=0.5, k=0.5)
- Scaling confirmed: |Δ| ∝ k² at fixed m for small k; saturates as BCC correction grows

**SR-2 Part B** (numerical propagation, L=64, n=800):
- num-vs-pred = **2.9e-15** (machine precision — QCA dispersion exactly reproduced)
- num-vs-SR = 4.6e-4 (expected LV gap from BCC k/18 correction)
- ratio_lsq = 0.870675042647; ratio_pred = 0.870675042647; 1/γ_SR = 0.871139979394

| # | Test | Outcome | Key number |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GR-1 light deflection (open BC) | **PASS at 5%** | \|K\|=3.87, 3.3% off Einstein |
| 2 | QM-1 CHSH | **PASS** | Tsirelson residual 4.4e-16; lattice 2.2e-9 |
| 3 | SR-2 time dilation | **PASS** | num-vs-pred 2.9e-15 |

| 5 | GR-2 Shapiro (open BC) | **PASS at 0.1%** | ratio=1.00058, 0.06% off GR |
| 6 | QG-2 Planck LV | **PASS** | E_LV ≥ E_Planck at a≤l_P |

| 8 | QM-2 tunneling | **FAIL** | Klein paradox dominates; mean ratio 1.80 |
| 9 | GR-4 Mercury perihelion | **PASS** | 1.50% error at v²/c²=5.6e-3 |
| 10 | QG-4 Noether charge | **PASS** | |ΔQ|/Q=2.2e-16 at m=0 (chiral charge exact) |

**7/10 outright PASS; 1 mechanism-PASS/period-FAIL (QFT-5); 2 known partial failures (GR-3 factor-2, QM-2 Klein regime).**

### E1 phase-wrap correction needed

The `aharonov_bohm_test` gate uses `abs(measured - analytic) < 1e-12` which fails when the packet traverses the flux tube in the opposite sense (measuring −π instead of +π, error = 2π).  Fix: replace with `min(|Δ|, 2π−|Δ|) < 1e-12`.  Physics is correct — error mod 2π = 0.0 exactly.

## Next Steps

- Continue OCR/transcription for pages 61 onward in batches of ~15.
- **E1 gate fix:** update `aharonov_bohm_test` to use modulo-2π phase comparison.
- **QFT-5:** Wire 3-flavour dynamical Yukawa in `ca_unified.py` to upgrade period test from 11.85% to the 5% gate.
- **GR-3:** Implement Paper 6 §18 two-photon redshift fix (factor-of-2 correction already predicted and confirmed).
- **QM-2:** Restrict tunneling test to sub-critical regime (V₀ < m) to avoid Klein paradox contamination.

### v2 layered build landed (2026-05-15)

L1–L4 implemented end-to-end in a single session. All four layers pass; the 13 pre-existing phase tests (A–E + F) remain unchanged at the prior residuals.

| Layer | Module | Test passes | Notable result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | `ca_bcc.py` | 6/6 | BCC unitarity 7.9e-16, dispersion 7.2e-16, norm drift 3.7e-14/200 steps, A_0=I exact, small-k Weyl regression 5e-4 at \|k\|=0.005 |
| **L2** | `ca_core_exact.py` | 5/5 | 2D arccos dispersion unitarity 3.2e-16, norm drift 8.4e-15/200 steps, Paper 4 frequency-dependent c: Δc/c = -1.1% at \|k\|=0.5 along (1,1) (zero along axis) |
| **L3** | `ca_maxwell.py` | 3/3 + 1 info | Composite-photon dispersion ω=\|k\|/√3 at 0.21%; transversality 2ñ·E=0 at 4.6e-17; anisotropy verified (axis exact, diag err = k/18 analytically). Pointwise-bilinear curl residual scales as O(k) — full Paper 1 lines 84-90 smeared-photon construction is needed for the published O(k^3) bound, deferred |
| **L4** | `ca_emqg.py` | 3/3 | Static Poisson rel err 2.75% on 64x64, vacuum ρ=0 → c=c_0 exactly, lensing demo: probe at impact b=18 bends toward mass, deflection scaling Δ(2M)/Δ(M) = 1.83 (8.5% off analytic 2.0) |

**Discovery during L1:** the Paper 1 Eq. 15 transcription in `qca-papers-1-4-overview.md` had a sign typo on the second term of n_y (should be `+s_x c_y s_z`, not `−s_x c_y s_z`). Original form gave \|u² + \|n\|²\| up to 0.47 off unity at finite k; corrected form gives 4.4e-16. The reference doc transcription has been left for now (caveat applies to anyone reading line 53); the working code in `ca_bcc.py` carries the fix with an inline note. Should be back-fixed in the reference doc.

**Sign convention in L4:** the proposition's `c = c_0(1+φ/c_0²)^(-1)` had the wrong sign for gravitational lensing — with φ<0 in a well, that formula gives c>c_0 (light *speeds up*), and probes would deflect away from masses. Replaced with the GR-effective-medium form `c = c_0/(1 − 2φ/c_0²)`, which gives c<c_0 in the well and the correct deflection direction. Documented in `ca_emqg.py`.

**Fresh full-suite regression (2026-05-15):**
- `run_phase_tests.py`: 8/8 pass (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, D1, E1, E2) — residuals identical to prior baseline (D1 dispersion 8.88e-17, E1 phase 4.44e-16, E2 right leakage = 0.0)
- `run_phaseF_tests.py`: 5/5 pass (F1, F2, F3, F3b, F4) — residuals identical (F1 fermion diff 7.57e-16, F4 η match 7.57e-16)
- `run_L_tests.py`: L1 (6/6), L2 (5/5), L3 (3/3+info), L4 (3/3) — all PASS
- **Total: 13 + 17 = 30 tests passing; 0 failing.**

### 10× lattice resolution bump (2026-05-16)

Every lattice-size parameter `L` and proportionally-scaled spatial-feature size (Gaussian widths $\sigma$, impact parameters $b$, depression widths) in all three test runners and in `ca_emqg.py` was multiplied by 10. Full table in `changelog.md` 2026-05-16 (later). Time-domain parameters (step counts that index FFT bin width, dt values, μ², λ, y, G, dimensionless wavevectors, flux $\pi$) were preserved. Brillouin-zone *sampling* densities (L1.a / L2.a `K = linspace(..., 16, ...)`) were also preserved — those are verification-fineness, not model resolution.

Cells / memory now per test:
- L1.d BCC norm drift: $L=160 \Rightarrow 4.1\,\text{M}$ cells, FFT working memory $\sim 250\,\text{MB}$/spinor component.
- L4.c lensing, C1 Cayley refraction: $L=1280 \Rightarrow$ sparse-LU memory $\sim 10\,\text{GB}$ (O(L³) for 2D nested-dissection). Inline fallback notes ($L=384$–$512$) added if RAM-bound.
- F3b: $L=960 \Rightarrow$ Cayley sparse LU $\sim 5\,\text{GB}$.

**Tests have not yet been re-run at the new size.** Bit-for-bit identity tests (F1, F4, D1 Weyl-regression-at-m=0) should still hit machine precision because the rule is unchanged; the failure mode to watch for is the Cayley arm running out of RAM at L=1280.

### 10× test execution pass — what actually happened when the bumped tests were run (2026-05-16, later)

Detailed entry: `changelog.md` 2026-05-16 ("10× test execution pass"). Detailed per-finding writeups: `findings.md` Findings 3–6 plus the Finding 2 update.

**Summary table:**

| Test | What changed at 10× | Match to existing formula |
|---|---|---|
| L1 BCC unitarity / dispersion / A_0 | unchanged, machine precision | — |
| L1.d norm drift | scanned at L=40, 80, 120; all at the FFT floor; full $L=160$ run incomplete (wall time) | — |
| L2 norm drift, 200 vs 2000 steps at L=320 | ratio = 9.985, exact 10× per-step | 1 ulp of complex128 per step |
| L3 curl residual k-scan ($10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}$) | curl/k → $1/\sqrt 6 = 0.408248290\ldots$ to 7 sig figs at $k=10^{-5}$ | **$1/\sqrt 6$, exact algebraic from BCC geometry** |
| L4.a static Poisson rel err | 2.75% → 1.39% at L=640 | finer k-grid; modest 2× |
| L4.c lensing at L=1280 | not executed (Cayley LU ≈ 10 GB exceeds sandbox memory) | — |
| D1 Weyl regression m=0 | $5\times 10^{-16}$ → $1.55\times 10^{-15}$ | $\sqrt{N_\text{cells}}$ FFT roundoff |
| D1 norm drift 1000 steps | $3.4\times 10^{-14}$ → $4.0\times 10^{-13}$ | $\sqrt N$ per step (11.6× vs predicted 10×) |
| D1 dispersion | $8.88\times 10^{-17}$ → $1.28\times 10^{-17}$ | machine zero |
| D1 zitterbewegung at 10× n_steps | 3.53% → 0.026% (135× improvement) | FFT-bin-limited; $2mc^2$ holds within resolution |
| B1 speed_ratio at L=640 | 0.92–0.98 → 0.9995–0.9999 | $v_g = c\hat k$ holds tighter as σ grows |
| E1 phase err | $4.44\times 10^{-16}$ unchanged | eigenvalue-phase floor |
| E1 norm drift with A0 | $3.6\times 10^{-12}$ → $4.3\times 10^{-10}$ | $\sqrt N$ over 100 steps (120× vs predicted ~100×) |
| E2 parity violation | 8-decimal agreement, right leakage = 0.0 exact | unchanged |
| F1 vacuum regression | **DIVERGES at default n_phi_sub=1**; PASSES at machine precision with n_phi_sub=2 | **CFL bound: $dt_\text{sub} < 2/\sqrt{8+2\mu^2}$** (Finding 4) |
| F2 Higgs radial dispersion | $1.06\times 10^{-3}$ → $1.00\times 10^{-3}$ | O(dt²) Verlet, not L-limited |
| F2 Goldstone dispersion | $4.4\times 10^{-4}$ → res/(\|k\|·ε) ≤ 0.88 | **Exactly massless** (Finding 3) |
| F3 symplectic Yukawa at L=320 (sub-scaled) | $H_\text{rel}$ = 0.0002%, same shape as prior L=64 | symplectic contract preserved |
| F3b at L=960 | not executed (Cayley LU ≈ 5 GB exceeds sandbox memory) | — |
| F4 symmetry restored | $|\Phi|=0$ exact, η match $2.3\times 10^{-15}$ | bit-for-bit identity survives |

**Updated exactness count:** 8 exact algebraic results (6 prior + Goldstone-massless + curl-residual-leading-1/√6).

**Tests with hidden CFL bugs surfaced by the 10× bump:** F1 (Finding 4). The empirical critical dt at L=320 lies between 0.85 and 0.95; the safe theoretical CFL bound is 0.667. `n_phi_sub=2` is needed at L=320 with `dt=1.0`.

**Tests not executed at the 10× size due to sandbox memory limits:** F3b (L=960 → ~5 GB), L4.c lensing (L=1280 → ~10 GB), C1 Cayley arm (L=1280 → ~10 GB). Fallback values (L=384–512) noted in the test files; not run here.

**No data matched an imaginary-number approximation** in the sense suggested by the user prompt example. All formula matches that surfaced are real-valued algebraic constants ($1/\sqrt 6$, $\varepsilon_\text{double}$, the CFL bound, $2mc^2$).


## 2026-05-19 - 22:53 — Top-10 priority test sweep complete

Built and executed all ten tests in the priority ranking from
`lattice-vs-spacetime-tests.md`.  Scripts live in
`model-tests/tests-priority/test_NN_*.py`; results in
`test-results/top10_T*.json`.  Detailed write-up: Finding 14
(§14.1 – §14.14) in `findings.md`.

| # | Test | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GR-1 light deflection | **PASS at 5%** with open-BC Poisson, $|K|=3.88$ (3.0% off 4); 12.5% off under PBC |
| 2 | QM-1 CHSH Bell | **PASS** — Tsirelson saturated at $4.4\times 10^{-16}$ |
| 3 | SR-2 time dilation | **PASS** (re-confirmed) at $4.4\times 10^{-15}$ |
| 4 | GR-3 Pound-Rebka | Lattice matches Paper 6 $c(x)$ at $0.2\%$; falsifies it vs measured GR by factor 2 |
| 5 | GR-2 Shapiro absolute | **PASS at 0.1%** with open-BC Poisson, ratio $=1.0006$; PPN $\gamma=1$ |
| 6 | QG-2 Planck LV | **PASS** at Planck $a$; $E_\text{LV} = 1.87\times 10^{20}$ GeV |
| 7 | QFT-5 neutrino | mechanism PASS at $4.4\times 10^{-16}$; 3-flavour peak at 553 km |
| 8 | QM-2 tunneling | 2% match at $V_0=0.15$, $w=6$; Klein-paradox dominates elsewhere |
| 9 | GR-4 Mercury perihelion | **PASS** at 1.5% at $v^2/c^2 = 5.6\times 10^{-3}$ |
| 10 | QG-4 Noether charge | **PASS at FFT floor**; $|\Delta Q|/Q = 1.83\times 10^{-13}$/1000 steps |

**Five outright passes** (QM-1, SR-2, QG-2, GR-4, QG-4).  **Two
near-misses with PBC-limited convergence** (GR-1, GR-2).  **One
mechanism-exact / phenomenology-partial** (QFT-5).  **One
narrow-window pass + Klein inheritance** (QM-2).  **One concrete
falsification of a Paper 6 sub-prediction** (GR-3 factor-2 redshift).

The most strategic outcomes are:

- **QM-1 CHSH at Tsirelson** confirms the lattice supports genuine
  non-local quantum correlations.
- **GR-4 Mercury at 1.5%** is the first second-order-in-$GM/(rc^2)$
  GR test the lattice has cleared.
- **QG-2 brackets Finding 10's SI mapping** numerically:
  $a \lesssim 1.5\times 10^{-34}$ m is the largest spacing consistent
  with Fermi GRB bounds on LV.
- **GR-3 falsifies the Paper 6 $c(x)$ ansatz** — by exactly factor 2,
  precisely the prediction.

Outstanding infrastructure: ~~open-BC Poisson solver~~ **(done
2026-05-20, `poisson_open.py`; GR-1 now passes 5% gate at $|K|=3.88$)**,
3-flavour wired Yukawa in `ca_unified.py` (would upgrade QFT-5 from
mechanism check to dynamical test), and the Paper 6 §18 redshift fix
(would resolve GR-3).

### 2026-05-20 - 18:09 — Open-BC Poisson + GR-1 & GR-2 re-tests

Built `ca-simulation/poisson_open.py` (James/Hockney zero-padded FFT,
free-space $1/r$ Green's function recovered to machine precision at
$r \ge 20$).  Both GR-domain line-integral tests improve dramatically:

- **GR-1 deflection** (`model-tests/tests-priority/test_01b_GR1_openBC.py`):
  $|K| = 3.50$ (PBC, 12.5% off Einstein) → $|K| = 3.88$ (open BC, 3.0%
  off) — **PASS at the 5% gate**.  Remaining 3% is finite Gaussian
  source extent ($\sigma/b = 3/8$), not a lattice limitation.
- **GR-2 Shapiro** (`model-tests/tests-priority/test_05b_GR2_openBC.py`):
  ratio $0.5$ (PBC, 38% off) → $1.0006$ (open BC, 0.06% off) —
  **PASS at the 0.1% gate**, pinning PPN $\gamma = 1$.

The periodic-Poisson kernel was the single largest accuracy limit on
the GR-domain tests, exactly as Finding 14.9 predicted.  Memory ceiling
in the sandbox is $L=192$ (doubled grid).


### 2026-05-21 - 15:08 — GR-3 cross-fork harness: all three Finding 14.5 fixes resolve the redshift, Fork C is the falsifier

Ran `ca-simulation/forks/gr3_fork_harness.py` over {baseline, Fork A
phase-tick, Fork B anisotropic, Fork C restricted-$c$} on one shared
open-BC potential ($L=128$, $M=1$, $\sigma=3$, $G_N=5\times10^{-4}$,
$c_0=0.5$). Headline:

| Fork | GR-1 $K$ | GR-2 | GR-3 ratio$_{GR}$ | GR-4 $\Delta\omega/\Delta\omega_\text{GR}$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **1.9991** | 2.0033 |
| Fork A | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **1.0001** | 2.0033 |
| Fork B | −3.8511 | 1.0018 | **1.0002** | 2.0033 |
| Fork C | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **0.9998** | **1.0006** |

- **GR-3 (the target) is fixed by all three candidate forks** — the
  Pound–Rebka ratio drops from the baseline factor-2 (1.9991) to ≈1 in
  every fork. The factor-2 problem from Finding 14.5 is resolvable.
- **GR-1 and GR-2 are preserved** across all forks (photon sector
  untouched), so none of the fixes costs the deflection or Shapiro pass.
- **GR-4 Mercury is the discriminator.** Forks A and B are
  observationally degenerate with baseline ($\alpha_A=\alpha_B=1$);
  **Fork C predicts exactly half the perihelion advance**
  ($\alpha_A=\alpha_B=0.5$, $C/\text{baseline}=0.4995$). This is the
  experimentally falsifiable difference: a Mercury-class measurement at
  lattice precision would select Fork C (half advance) against A/B (full
  advance). Closed-form 1PN for C gives 0.5833 (with the
  $\alpha_A\alpha_B$ cross term) vs the integrated 0.4995 — caveat noted.
  Outputs in `test-results/gr3_fork_comparison.{json,md}`.

## 2026-05-22 - 13:42 — Real-space propagation demo + curl-residual geometry forks

**Goal.** Answer directly: (a) does a photon/fermion exist and *move across* the lattice, and (b) why does the composite-photon curl equation only close to $O(k)$? User proposed a fork test — working backwards from "$c_\text{lat}$ should be 1" — of whether simple-cubic geometry (instead of BCC) fixes both.

**Propagation demo** (`model-tests/run_propagation_demo.py`, results `test-results/propagation_demo_2026-05-22.json`, figure `test-results/figures/propagation_demo.png`). Three packets launched on a $64^3$ BCC lattice, group velocity read from the energy-density centroid over 44 ticks:

| Packet | measured $v_g$ | predicted | rel err |
|---|---|---|---|
| massless Weyl | 0.5752 | $1/\sqrt3$ | 0.37% |
| Dirac $m=0.3$ | 0.4667 | $d\omega/dk$ ($=0.81\,c_\text{lat}$) | 1.06% |
| composite photon | 0.5530 | $1/\sqrt3$ | 4.2% (finite-packet transverse-$k$ artifact) |

Momentum-space gates re-confirmed: transversality $4.6\times10^{-17}$, Poynting drift (with $c^2$, 200 steps) $4.8\times10^{-14}$. All three excitations traverse the lattice at $\approx c_\text{lat}$; the massive fermion is correctly subluminal. Method note: the Dirac packet must be seeded with the positive-energy 4-spinor eigenmode of $D_k$ (an $\eta$-only seed mixes $\pm$energy modes → zitterbewegung smears $v_g$ to 8.4% error). See `findings/F20-photon-fermion-propagation-demo.md`.

**Curl-residual geometry forks** (`ca-simulation/forks/curl_fork_{cubic,baseline_bcc,harness}.py`, results `test-results/curl_fork_results_2026-05-22.json`). Built a simple-cubic Weyl QCA fork ($c_\text{lat}=1$) and a BCC baseline fork on a common interface; harness measures $c_\text{lat}$, isotropy, curl-residual scaling, and doubler count. **Key result (F21):** the normalized curl residual is $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt2$ per unit $|k|$ on **every** geometry (BCC, simple-cubic, scaled-cubic $\alpha\in\{0.5,1,2\}$) to 6 figures. Cubic delivers $c_\text{lat}=1$ and marginally better isotropy, but the curl residual stays $O(k)$ (coefficient $1/\sqrt2$, worse than BCC's $1/\sqrt6$) **and** it reintroduces 8 Nielsen–Ninomiya fermion doublers vs the BCC single Weyl point. The earlier $1/\sqrt{2d}$ (Exactness #7) is the BCC special case of $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt2$. **Geometry is ruled out as the cause** of the $O(k)$ curl residual; it is intrinsic to the un-smeared pointwise bilinear. Next fork: Paper 1's smearing function $f_{\mathbf k}(\mathbf q)$, target = drive the coefficient to 0. Exactness Inventory: +1 Tier-1 (#49), now 50 exact algebraic results.

## 2026-05-23 - 16:35 — F28: F26 dispersion test against current LIV experiments

Wrote and ran `model-tests/test_F28_grb_dispersion.py`. Confronted F26's group-velocity
prediction ($v_g/c = 1 - \tfrac{1}{2}(E/E_\text{Planck})^2$) against best current
photon time-of-flight bounds (Fermi-LAT GRB 090510, LHAASO GRB 221009A, MAGIC Mrk 501).

**Verdict:** F26 is NOT excluded by any current experiment. The best constraint
(LHAASO GRB 221009A) is ~15 decades below the F26-predicted delay. Confirmation/
exclusion at the Planck-tick assumption requires ~$10^{20}$ eV photons from $z\sim 1$,
which is above the GZK cutoff — effectively unfalsifiable with photon TOF.

**Output:**
- `model-tests/test_F28_grb_dispersion.py` (script)
- `test-results/F28_grb_dispersion.json` (numerical results)
- `test-results/F28_grb_dispersion_summary.md` (markdown summary)
- `findings/F28-grb-dispersion-test.md` (formal finding)

**Side conclusion:** current LIV limits constrain the lattice tick duration to
$\tau_\text{lat} \lesssim 9 \times 10^{-37}$ s — i.e., anywhere between Planck time
and $\sim 10^7\,t_P$ is allowed. A scan over tick-rate values would convert the
current "untestable" verdict into a constraint on the lattice scale itself; that's
a cheap follow-up.
