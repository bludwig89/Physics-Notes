## 2026-06-01 - 16:42 — F70 + F71: confinement (gradient flow + exact static potential) and the first hadron (colour-singlet proton)

Answered the standing question "does the model predict why quarks can't exist alone, and can a proton be built?" — previously the major open frontier (the F43/FG-7 follow-up). Two new findings, three new modules, four new test suites (22 new tests, all PASS).

**F70 — confinement** ([F70](findings/F70-gradient-flow-confinement-string-tension.md)). New `ca-simulation/ca_cooling.py` (Wilson gradient flow: Lüscher RK3 + Euler; checkerboard cooling) and `ca-simulation/ca_confinement.py` (static potential / string tension). The gradient-flow driver passes its full correctness contract — cold fixed point (0.0), unitarity ($2.5\times10^{-14}$), monotone action, su(3) force ($5.6\times10^{-16}$), **gauge covariance** $\text{flow}(U^g)=\text{flow}(U)^g$ ($7.8\times10^{-15}$), diffusive $\propto\hat k^2$ smoothing ($4.9\times10^{-10}$) — `test_FG7b_gradient_flow.py` **6/6**. Confinement is now a **prediction**: in 2D the Wilson loop obeys an exact area law $\langle\tfrac1N\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,W\rangle=w(\beta)^{RT}$ ($w$ by deterministic SU(3) Weyl-torus quadrature), so the **string tension $\sigma(\beta)=-\ln w>0$ for every finite $\beta$**, the **static potential $V(R)=\sigma R$ is exactly linear** ($8.9\times10^{-16}$), and the **Creutz ratio $\chi(R,T)=\sigma$ is loop-size-independent** ($2.2\times10^{-16}$) — an isolated colour charge costs infinite energy. `test_FG7c_confinement.py` **8/8** (incl. MC cross-checks: lattice plaquette ↔ $w$; flow raises $\langle\text{plaq}\rangle 0.07\!\to\!0.96$, lowering $\sigma_\text{eff} 2.66\!\to\!0.04$ — confinement is in the disordered ensemble, cooling is a smoother not a confiner). Heavy MC confirmation provided as user-run `run_confinement_mc.py`.

**F71 — the proton** ([F71](findings/F71-colour-singlet-baryon-proton.md)). New `ca-simulation/ca_baryon.py` builds the colour-singlet baryon $B=\varepsilon_{abc}q_1^aq_2^bq_3^c$ ($uud$). `test_FG7d_baryon_singlet.py` **8/8**: $\varepsilon$ antisymmetric (0.0); colour-singlet gauge invariance $B\to\det(V)B=B$ under local $V(x)$ ($1.2\times10^{-15}$) — the proton is exactly colourless; zero total colour charge $G^a|S\rangle=0$ and Casimir $=0$ ($1.4\times10^{-16}$); proton quantum numbers $Q=+1,B=1,T_3=\tfrac12$ exact (`fractions.Fraction`), GMN-consistent; spin-flavour wavefunction fully $S_3$-symmetric (0.0); full wavefunction antisymmetric under quark exchange (Fermi, 0.0); energetic binding $V(R)=\sigma R\to\infty$ from F70. **Scope note:** F71 is an operator-level construction with correct quantum numbers, exchange symmetry and an energetic-binding argument — not yet a dynamical (real-time, non-dispersing, mass-measured) bound state. **Limitations carried forward:** 2D-exact confinement only (3+1D BCC string tension needs Monte-Carlo and a deconfinement transition); proton mass / QCD scale are uncalibrated Tier-B; a dynamical baryon simulation is the natural next step.

## 2026-05-29 - 21:10 — F53 / FG-9: antiparticle / per-species C and CP — last Tier-A structural item closed; 6/6 PASS

Closed the final open Tier-A structural item in [first-gen-completeness.md](first-gen-completeness.md) (§3 item 7, §5.1 row FG-9): explicit charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, and the combination $CP$ verified species by species, extending [`test_13_QFT8_CPT.py`](model-tests/tests-priority/test_13_QFT8_CPT.py) (which only proved the CPT *mass* equality) to the full discrete-symmetry triplet. New suite [`model-tests/test_FG9_C_CP_per_species.py`](model-tests/test_FG9_C_CP_per_species.py) — **6/6 parts PASS**. **P1** ($C$ antiparticle table): $C:(T_3,Q,Y)\to(-T_3,-Q,-Y)$ with Gell-Mann–Nishijima $Q=T_3+Y/2$ exact for *both* particle and antiparticle across all 8 first-gen Weyl species (`fractions.Fraction`, residual $0$). **P2** ($C$ maximal): the charged current couples to the left sector only, so the $C$-image (right) of each left doublet sources zero isospin current, $A_C=1$ bit-for-bit. **P3** ($P$ maximal): $A_P=(g_L-g_R)/(g_L+g_R)=1$ exact for $\nu_L,e_L,u_L,d_L$. **P4** ($CP$ conserved): $\lvert g_{\rm cc}(f_L)\rvert=\lvert g_{\rm cc}(\bar f_L)\rvert$; NC relation $g_R^{\bar f}=-g_L^f\Rightarrow\lvert g_L^f\rvert=\lvert g_R^{\bar f}\rvert$ for all 7 chiralities; single-generation Jarlskog count $N(n)=(n-1)(n-2)/2$ gives $N(1)=0$ exactly — no physical CP phase exists in one generation. **P5** (CP-phase pure gauge): the lone candidate CP-odd parameter, the F27 complex-mass phase $\theta$, is unphysical — the one-tick operator's eigenphase spectrum is θ-independent ($3.3\times10^{-16}$ over $\theta\in\{0,\pi/3,\pi/2,2,\pi\}$ × 4 momenta, mirroring F27 T3) and a chiral rephasing $\chi\to e^{+i\theta}\chi$ removes $\theta$ bit-for-bit ($9\times10^{-16}$). **P6** (CPT per species): $\omega(+m)=\omega(-m)$ algebraically and numerically over 300 ticks at $0.0$ residual, $\lVert C\psi\rVert^2$ conserved. The early propagation-based $\omega(\theta)$ measurement that reported a spurious θ-dependence was a branch-mixing artefact; the correct, spectral statement is what P5 verifies. Independently cross-checked with sympy. Net new: **6 Tier-1 algebraic (#136–#141) + 3 Tier-2 machine-precision (#51–#53)**. Finding [F53](findings/F53-fg9-C-CP-per-species.md); results [test-results/FG9_C_CP_per_species.json](test-results/FG9_C_CP_per_species.json). **With FG-9 closed, the only remaining Tier-A item is FG-8** (β-decay $d\to u+e^-+\bar\nu_e$ end-to-end integration).

## 2026-05-29 - 20:48 — F54 / FG-8: end-to-end β-decay charged-current integration — 10/10 PASS (last Tier-A structural item; first generation now structurally complete)

Closed the β-decay charged current $d\to u+W^-\to u+e^-+\bar\nu_e$ — the signature first-generation weak process and the last open Tier-A structural row in [first-gen-completeness.md](first-gen-completeness.md) §5.1. New *additive* module [`ca-simulation/ca_charged_current.py`](ca-simulation/ca_charged_current.py) introduces the charged-current raising/lowering structure — generators $T^\pm=T^1\pm iT^2$ with $[T^3,T^\pm]=\pm T^\pm$, $[T^+,T^-]=2T^3$; charged bosons $W^\pm=(W^1\mp iW^2)/\sqrt2$; site currents $J^\pm=f_\text{up}^*f_\text{down}=J^1\pm iJ^2$ — on top of F29 (doublet bilinears), F34 (lepton–W vertex + parity violation), FG-2/FG-3 (quark–W vertex), F36 (Proca W), and F35/F48 (charge registry), changing no existing surface. New suite [`model-tests/test_FG8_beta_decay.py`](model-tests/test_FG8_beta_decay.py) — **10/10 PASS in 0.48 s**. **CC1** SU(2) charged-current algebra exact ($0.0$). **CC2** $d\to u$ raising $T^+\lvert d\rangle=\lvert u\rangle$ with transition charge $\Delta Q=+1=-Q(W^-)$ exact over `fractions.Fraction`. **CC3** charge conservation at *both* vertices ($d\to u+W^-$ and $W^-\to e^-\bar\nu_e$). **CC4** maximal parity violation: V−A projector $P_L=(1-\gamma^5)/2$ kills the right-handed spinor and is identity on the left ($0.0$ bit-for-bit). **CC5** quark–lepton universality of $J^+$ ($0.0$). **CC6** the $W^-$ field is sourced by the raising quark current exactly, $\Delta E(W^-)=(g/\sqrt2)J^+ dt$ ($9.2\times10^{-16}$). **CC7** Proca $W^-$ dispersion $\omega^2=m_W^2+\Omega_\text{even}^2(k)$ over 3 masses × 3 components ($3.1\times10^{-13}$). **CC8** heavy-W Fermi limit $G_F/\sqrt2=g^2/8m_W^2$ exact at $q^2=0$, relative deviation $-q^2/(m_W^2+q^2)$. **CC9** full process $d\to u+e^-+\bar\nu_e$: $\Delta Q=\Delta B=\Delta L=\Delta(B-L)=0$ exact. **CC10** end-to-end pipeline — quark current sources a $W^-$ at site A ($\lvert W^-\rvert=0.36$) that propagates causally (24 Proca ticks) to a distant site B (signal $1.6\times10^{-13}\to2.9\times10^{-3}$) with global charge balanced. Independently re-derived outside the harness. Net new: **7 Tier-1 (#142–148) + 2 Tier-2 (#54–55) + 1 Tier-3 (#27)**. Finding [F54](findings/F54-fg8-beta-decay-charged-current.md); results [test-results/FG8_beta_decay.json](test-results/FG8_beta_decay.json). **Numbering note:** built concurrently with FG-9; both first claimed F53 — FG-9 keeps **F53**, this β-decay finding is **F54**, exactness rows slotted after FG-9's reserved #136–141/#51–53. **With FG-8 and FG-9 both closed, every §5.1 Tier-A first-generation structural test is done**; what remains is Tier-B calibration (CO-1 SI units, couplings, absolute masses).

## 2026-05-28 - 01:30 — F43 FG-7: dynamical SU(3) gluon sector — rotation law, Yang–Mills self-coupling, Wilson-loop diagnostic, quark-current back-reaction; 20/20 tests PASS

Brought the colour sector up to the level the $W$ reached in F29/F33/F36 (the user-asked completion item: "dynamical gluon propagation, gluon self-coupling, confinement diagnostic"). New module `ca-simulation/ca_gluon.py` (additive — no edits to `ca_strong.py` or `ca_wmu.py`) implements four phases on both 2D-square and 3D BCC lattices: **(A)** colour-octet bilinear $G^{a,i}(x) = \sum_f q_f^\dagger \sigma^i T^a q_f$ + free F26 rotation per $a$-component; **(B)** Wilson plaquette $G^a_{\mu\nu} = (2/g a^2)\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}[T^a U_\square]$ + Yang–Mills self-coupling tick via SU(3) structure constants $f^{abc}$ (Jacobi identity at $1.1\times 10^{-16}$); **(C)** Wilson-loop framework `wilson_loop_2d_{rect, avg, gauge_residual, area_law_data}`; **(D)** sourced gluon step $\partial_t E^a = \Omega B^a + g J^a$ wrapping `ca_strong.noether_charge_density`. New test suite [`test_FG7_gluon_dynamics.py`](model-tests/test_FG7_gluon_dynamics.py) 20/20 PASS in 0.42 s; results [test-results/FG7_gluon_dynamics.json](test-results/FG7_gluon_dynamics.json). Headline numbers: cold-link $G^a = 0$ bit-for-bit on both lattices (PB.1, PB.2 = $0.0$); cold-link Wilson loop $\langle\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,W(r,t)\rangle = N_c = 3$ exactly for all $r,t\in\{1,2,3\}$ (PC.1 = $0.0$); local SU(3) gauge invariance of Wilson loops at $4.6\times 10^{-16}$ (PC.2); constant-$V$ plaquette $\|G\|^2$ invariance $5.4\times 10^{-15}$ (PB.4); $m_g=0$ massive step bit-for-bit equals free step (PD.3 = $0.0$); diagonal source coupling across all 8 octet components at exact zero (PD.2, PD.5); free-gluon BCC dispersion $\omega(k) = \Omega^+(k)$ to $1.7\times 10^{-13}$ over 50 ticks (PD.4). Strong-coupling decorrelation $|W|/N_c \approx 4\%$ on Haar-random links (PC.3) — the strong-coupling baseline of confinement diagnostics. New finding [F43](findings/F43-fg7-dynamical-gluons.md). Net new: **13 Tier-1 algebraic + 5 Tier-2 machine-precision** entries (#116–#128 / #43–#47). Tally: 128 Tier-1 / 47 Tier-2. Closes [first-gen-completeness.md](first-gen-completeness.md) §3 item 6 and the §5.1 FG-7 row. The linear-confinement regime (Creutz ratios, static $q\bar q$ potential) needs real-time link Hamiltonian evolution from a near-identity start; the `wilson_loop_2d_*` primitives are in place, the cooling/Kogut–Susskind driver is the natural follow-up. The only remaining first-gen item is FG-4 (dynamical $Z$).

## 2026-05-26 - 17:45 — F41 hypercharge merged into main model as `ca_hypercharge.py`; U(1)_Y compatible with Higgs-free F27

Answered the open question "are the hypercharge fields affected by abandoning the Higgs?" with a new module that extends the F27 chiral-SU(2)_L mass step to also be exactly $U(1)_Y$-invariant. The Higgs-equivalent hypercharge $\Delta Y = Y_L - Y_R$ is absorbed into the pure-gauge field $U(x) \to U(x)\cdot\mathrm{diag}(e^{+i\alpha\Delta Y_\nu/2}, e^{+i\alpha\Delta Y_e/2})$ — no Higgs boson reintroduced; the extra phase d.o.f. is eaten by the Z under Stueckelberg (F34b). **7/7 tests PASS** in 0.014 s: $U(1)_Y$ Ward identity for the e-branch $9.04\times10^{-16}$ and ν-branch $9.16\times10^{-16}$; $\alpha\equiv 0$ reduces bit-for-bit to the F27 step ($0.0$); $SU(2)_L$ Ward identity preserved with random $\alpha$ at $9.16\times10^{-16}$; zero isospin leakage with $U=I$ ($0.0$); 50-step unitarity drift $4.5\times10^{-15}$; Gell-Mann–Nishijima algebra exact. **The SU(2) lepton field is verified NOT affected**. New finding: [F41](findings/F41-hypercharge-higgs-free-su2.md). Tests: [model-tests/test_hypercharge_fork.py](model-tests/test_hypercharge_fork.py). Module: `ca-simulation/ca_hypercharge.py` (kept in its own file per request, promoted from `forks/`).

## 2026-05-26 - 16:30 — F40 / FG-2 + FG-3: F27 complex mass adopted for quarks AND quark doublet wired to W_μ

Closed two of the three structural gaps from the [first-gen-completeness-review.md](first-gen-completeness-review.md): quark mass via the adopted F27 chiral-SU(2) mechanism (replacing the Higgs–Yukawa path), and the quark doublet $(u,d)_L$ coupled to a 2D-square $W_\mu$ link field (the analog of F31/F34 in the strong sector). Two test suites both pass. **FG-2 11/11** at machine precision: F27 quark mass works per-flavour, per-colour with up/down/strange splitting (ratios $r_d/r_u=3.96$ vs $4$, $r_s/r_u=15.22$ vs $16$); U(1) β-gauge Ward identity $1.2\times10^{-16}$; cold-link θ=0 regression bit-for-bit exact ($0.0$); degenerate-doublet SU(2)$_L$ Ward identity $8.4\times10^{-17}$; colour-charge conserved $1.7\times10^{-14}$; **Q10 and Q11 diagnostics confirm** that split mass and the kinetic step both fail Ward identity without $W_\mu$ (residuals 0.24 and 0.57), which triggered Phase 4. **FG-3 6/6**: the W-covariant quark doublet step gives **SU(2)$_L$ Ward identity exact for constant $V(x)$ at $2.8\times10^{-16}$** (F34 W4.1 quark analog), right-handed $\chi$ exactly decoupled from $W$ at $m=0$ ($0.0$ bit-for-bit), and colour-charge conservation $2.5\times10^{-14}$. Net new: 6 Tier-1 algebraic + 4 Tier-2 + 1 Tier-3 results. Findings: [F40](findings/F40-quark-f27-mass-and-electroweak.md). Tests: [test_FG2_quark_complex_mass.py](model-tests/test_FG2_quark_complex_mass.py), [test_FG3_quark_electroweak.py](model-tests/test_FG3_quark_electroweak.py). Results: `test-results/FG2_quark_complex_mass.json`, `test-results/FG3_quark_electroweak.json`. Closes review §3 items 1–2; the next FG targets are FG-4 (dynamical $Z$) and FG-7 (dynamical gluons + confinement).

## 2026-05-26 - 03:15 — FG-6 two-helicity composite photon bilinear: F^+→Ω^+ and F^-→Ω^- to 1.5e-15; F30 birefringence reproduced

Extended `ca_maxwell.py` so the composite photon bilinear is built from BOTH BCC chirality branches (sign='+' AND sign='-'), closing the structural gap noted in [first-gen-completeness-review.md](first-gen-completeness-review.md) §3 item 4. Added five new functions: `EM_bilinears_branch` (sign-aware singlet), `EM_bilinears_two_helicity` (assembler with per-branch complex weights), `riemann_silberstein_decomp` (F^± = E ± iB), `triplet_bilinear_branch` (W^a per branch), and `triplet_bilinear_two_helicity` (assembler for the W-triplet). New test suite [`test_FG6_two_helicity_photon.py`](model-tests/test_FG6_two_helicity_photon.py) — 10/10 PASS in 0.30 s. Headline results: under chiral propagation `w_propagation_step_spectral`, F^+(k) tracks Ω^+(k) and F^-(k) tracks Ω^-(k) across single-branch and combined initial states to 1.5e-15 over 10 ticks (12 cases); birefringence ΔΩ on the (1,1,1) body diagonal reproduces F30's $-\sqrt3/27 \approx -0.06415$ to 4.5e-5 relative; per-branch singlet SU(2) invariance and triplet adjoint at machine precision (3.4e-16 and 2.6e-16); Riemann-Silberstein E = (F^++F^-)/2 identity exact (0.0). The F29-B4 raw triplet transversality $c_\text{lat}\!\cdot\!|k|$ scaling reproduces per branch (2.9e-2 at k=0.05). Net new: 4 Tier-1 exact entries (#92–95); tally now **95 exact algebraic / 25 machine-precision**. Results: [test-results/FG6_two_helicity_photon.json](test-results/FG6_two_helicity_photon.json). New finding: [F39](findings/F39-two-helicity-photon-bilinear.md). Closes FG-6 in the completeness review §5.1 and item 4 of §3; the remaining "two-helicity photon" item is the experimental confrontation with polarisation data (Tier B).

## 2026-05-26 - 02:02 — FG-1 anomaly cancellation: all six traces exactly zero (closes the first capstone test from the completeness review)

Ran the FG-1 anomaly cancellation test specced in [first-gen-completeness-review.md](first-gen-completeness-review.md) §5.1. Implemented as `model-tests/test_FG1_anomaly_cancellation.py` using `fractions.Fraction` so every trace is an exact rational, not a floating-point near-zero. The L-handed Weyl content of one generation in the $Q = T_3 + Y/2$ convention — $L=(\nu,e)_L$, $e^c_L$, $Q=(u,d)_L$, $u^c_L$, $d^c_L$ — satisfies all six anomaly conditions exactly: $\sum_i n_i Y_i = -2+2+2-4+2 = 0$ (grav–$U(1)_Y$); $\sum_i n_i Y_i^3 = -2 + 8 + \tfrac{6-192+24}{27} = 6-6 = 0$ ($U(1)_Y^3$); $[SU(2)]^2\!\cdot\!Y = -\tfrac12+\tfrac12 = 0$; $[SU(3)]^2\!\cdot\!Y = \tfrac13-\tfrac23+\tfrac13 = 0$; $[SU(3)]^3 = 2-1-1 = 0$ (vector-like colour); $[SU(2)]^3 = 0$ (pseudo-real). Gell-Mann–Nishijima charges $Q = T_3 + Y/2$ also reproduced exactly per particle (cross-check of F35 W6.4). Net new: 6 Tier-1 exact algebraic results (#86–91); tally now 91 exact / 25 machine-precision. Results: [test-results/FG1_anomaly_cancellation.json](test-results/FG1_anomaly_cancellation.json). New finding: [F38](findings/F38-fg1-anomaly-cancellation.md). This closes the §2.3 "anomaly cancellation … not tested" row in the completeness review and supersedes the corresponding caveat in F27. The algebraic half of QFT-6 in `lattice-vs-spacetime-tests.md` is now closed (status annotated SPLIT); the dynamical half — measuring $\partial_\mu j^\mu_5 = E\!\cdot\!B$ on the lattice in a uniform-field background — remains open as a separate test requiring a finite-density chiral current and EM source.

## 2026-05-25 - 14:00 — First-generation completeness review: quark electroweak wiring is the key missing piece

Conducted a rigorous review of the model against the requirements for a complete first-generation Standard-Model particle sector, written to [first-gen-completeness-review.md](first-gen-completeness-review.md). Verdict: the lepton + electroweak sector is structurally near-complete (F27 chiral mass, F34 lepton–W vertex, F35 EW mixing), but the **quark sector (`ca_strong.py`) carries no electroweak charge** — verified there is zero SU(2)/W/Z/hypercharge wiring — so the generation is currently two disconnected halves. Top structural gaps: (1) wire $(u,d)_L$ + $u_R,d_R$ to the electroweak sector; (2) adopt the F27 complex-mass mechanism for quarks (they still use the dropped Higgs–Yukawa path); (3) complete the photon as two-helicity (currently `sign='+'` only, F37/F30) and promote $Z$/gluons from algebraic/link-variable to dynamical fields. Highest-value near-term test is **anomaly cancellation** (specced as QFT-6, never run; F27 notes it untested). A calibration tier (couplings, masses, SI units — blocked on F10) is laid out separately. File audit flags `forks/complex_mass_fork.py` as a clean retire (merged into `ca_dirac.py`), `ca_weak.py`/`ca_higgs.py`/`ca_unified.py` as design-superseded but still wired into legacy runners, and several completed fork harnesses to archive; duplicate result dirs (`ca-simulation/test-results`, `ca-simulation/figures`, `model-tests/test-results`) to consolidate.

## 2026-05-24 - 00:00 — F37: RS eigenstates correspond exactly to BCC chirality branches; vacuum birefringence identified

Pure derivation (no new code). Proved that $\mathbf{F}_\pm = \mathbf{E}\pm i\mathbf{B}$ (Riemann–Silberstein helicity eigenstates) correspond exactly to BCC branches $\Omega^\pm(k)$ via two independent constraints: (1) eigenvalue structure of the rotation matrix $R(\Omega)$, and (2) Hermitian-symmetry requirement $\mathbf{F}_+(-k) = \mathbf{F}_-^*(k)$ on real fields — which forces the unique assignment $\phi^+(-k)=\phi^-(k)$, satisfied exactly by the BCC parity relation $\Omega^+(-k)=\Omega^-(k)$. Consequence: the current $\Omega_\text{even}$ W-propagation averages out physical vacuum birefringence $\Delta\Omega\approx-\sqrt{3}k^2/27$ (from F30) between the two circular polarisations. A chirally-faithful propagation law working in the $(C_+,C_-)$ basis preserves Hermitian symmetry while exposing this birefringence. The composite photon in `ca_maxwell.py` (built from `sign='+'` only) is already a single-helicity object on $\Omega^+$. Four Tier-1 exact entries added (#82–85); tally now 85 algebraic exact. Full derivation: [F37](findings/F37-rs-bcc-chirality-helicity.md).

## 2026-05-24 - 00:00 — WMU Phase 7: back-reaction closes fermion↔boson loop; Proca dispersion verified

Implemented and verified Phase 7 of the WMU roadmap: Yang-Mills fermion-to-gauge back-reaction and massive W (Proca) propagation. Added three functions to `ca_wmu.py`: `fermion_isospin_current` computes $J^a(x) = \psi_L^\dagger(\tau^a/2)\psi_L$ from the left-handed doublet (upper Weyl components only); `w_sourced_propagation_step` implements the linearized Yang-Mills source term $D_\mu F^{a,\mu\nu} = gJ^{a,\nu}$ as a free F26 rotation followed by a real-space source kick $E^a \mathrel{+}= gJ^a dt$; `w_massive_propagation_step_spectral` implements the Proca dispersion $\omega^2 = m_W^2 + \Omega_\text{even}^2(k)$ by replacing the rotation angle $\Omega \to \sqrt{m_W^2+\Omega^2}$. Test suite `test_wmu_phase7_backreaction.py` 5/5 PASS: isospin current exact for pure and mixed states; diagonal coupling verified to exact zero (W1=W2=0 under J3-only source); Proca dispersion residual $\leq 1.4\times10^{-13}$ for $m_W \in \{0.1, 0.3, 0.8\}$; massless limit exact to 0.0. Net new: 4 Tier-1 exact algebraic (#78–81), 2 Tier-2 machine-precision (#24–25). Tally now 81 exact / 25 machine-precision. New finding: [F36](findings/F36-wmu-backreaction.md).

## 2026-05-24 - 23:30 — WMU Roadmap complete: all 6 phases pass; electroweak sector fully implemented

Executed `roadmap-wmu-implementation.md` end-to-end. All 30 tests across 6 phases now pass (Phases 1–2 completed in prior sessions; Phases 3–6 completed in this session). Phase 3 (Yang–Mills self-coupling) confirms the Wilson plaquette field strength $F^a_{\mu\nu}$ is identically zero for identity links and gauge-invariant under constant SU(2) rotations ($5.9\times10^{-16}$). Phase 4 (fermion-W vertex) wires the covariant Dirac doublet to the W links via the Strang-split `covariant_dirac_doublet_step`; the Ward identity holds at $1.7\times10^{-17}$, and right-handed $\chi$ is exactly decoupled at $m=0$ (residual 0.0). Phase 5B (Stueckelberg W mass) promotes the F27 mass link to a dynamical field; the mass $m_W = g\sqrt{\langle|\partial U_\text{st}|^2\rangle}$ is invariant under constant SU(2) left-multiplication (exact, 0.0) and the gradient flow reduces kinetic energy 79.5% in 5 steps. Phase 6 (electroweak mixing) implements the Weinberg-angle rotation $W^3 \leftrightarrow B \to A, Z$; the mass ratio $m_Z/m_W = 1/\cos\theta_W$ is algebraically exact (0.0), Gell-Mann–Nishijima $Q = T_3 + Y/2$ holds to $5.6\times10^{-17}$ for all 7 particles, and the commutator $[\text{mix}, \text{propagate}] = 0$ is verified at machine precision. Net new results: 8 exact algebraic (Tier 1 #70–77) and 6 machine-precision (Tier 2 #18–23) added to [exactness-inventory.md](exactness-inventory.md). New findings: [F33](findings/F33-wmu-yang-mills.md), [F34](findings/F34-wmu-fermion-vertex.md), [F34b](findings/F34b-wmu-mass-stueckelberg.md), [F35](findings/F35-electroweak-mixing.md). Total Tier-1 count: 77 (forecast was ~88; 30 tests with ~25 algebraic relations realised).

## 2026-05-24 - 17:31 — F30: photon-dispersion LIV order is anisotropic; the linear term is chiral (birefringent), not net time-of-flight

Settled the standing n=1 vs n=2 contradiction between F25/F26/F28 (claimed quadratic $-\Omega^2/6$) and `roadmap-f26-rotation.md` (claimed linear $-k/18$). Exact sympy expansion of $\Omega^\pm = 2\,\omega^\pm_\text{BCC}(\mathbf{k}/2)$ shows the BCC vacuum is anisotropic: $c$ is exact on the cube axes (no LIV), the correction is $n=2$ along $(1,1,0)$, and $n=1$ ($-k/18$) along the body diagonal $(1,1,1)$ — so the roadmap value is the correct *single-chirality* result. The chirality decomposition resolves the conflict: the linear term has opposite sign for the two Weyl branches, so it cancels in unpolarised light (net time-of-flight is $n=2$ everywhere — F28's "untestable" verdict upheld, but via chiral cancellation) and survives only as **linear vacuum birefringence** ($\Omega^+-\Omega^- = -\sqrt3\,k^2/27$, $\Delta v_\phi/c=-k/9$ on $(1,1,1)$, zero on axes). This shifts the decisive empirical test of F26 from GRB time-of-flight to GRB/AGN polarisation. Open item: the code's composite photon is built from a single chirality branch (`sign='+'`); whether the physical photon's two helicities inherit $\Omega^\pm$ (and is thus birefringent) must be settled by extending the bilinear construction to both branches. Tier 1 entries #68–#69 added to [exactness-inventory.md](exactness-inventory.md). Full writeup: [F30](findings/F30-photon-dispersion-order-anisotropy-birefringence.md); script `model-tests/test_F30_dispersion_order.py`, results in `test-results/F30_dispersion_order.{json,md}`.

## 2026-05-24 - 22:00 — W1.4 k-space Ward identity verified; full W1 suite 6/6 PASS

W1.4 now passes at $1.21\times 10^{-17}$ (target $10^{-14}$) using `covariant_weyl_step_3d_bcc_exact` + `gauge_transform_links_kspace`, both driven by the fractional `e^{ik\cdot d/\sqrt{3}}` BCC hop phase.  The Ward identity $V\cdot\mathrm{step}(\psi;U)=\mathrm{step}(V\psi;VUV^\dagger)$ is algebraically exact for constant gauge fields; the $\sim 3\times 10^{-2}$ random-field residual is a Nyquist-aliasing artifact inherent to the finite lattice, not a model failure.  Entry #67 added to [exactness-inventory.md](exactness-inventory.md).  Full W1 phase-1 suite: W1.1–W1.6 all PASS.

## 2026-05-24 - 21:30 — Exact BCC fractional-shift architecture implemented

The fundamental distinction between the BCC QCA hop `exp(i k·d/√3)` and an integer `np.roll` shift `exp(i k·d)` is now crystallised in a dedicated utility `bcc_fractional_shift` in `ca_bcc.py`, and an exact gauge-covariant fermion step `covariant_weyl_step_3d_bcc_exact` in `ca_wmu.py`.  The exact step uses the `_SPINOR_MATS` decomposition `U_BCC(k) = Σ_d M_d exp(i k·d/√3)` to apply the gauge link at each BCC direction individually, avoiding the O(a) site-averaging approximation of `covariant_weyl_step_3d_bcc`.  New W1.6 test verifies the exact step equals `weyl_step_3d_bcc` for identity links at 1.1e-17 residual; `_SPINOR_MATS` decomposition error is 4.1e-16.  Full W1 suite: 6/6 PASS.  See [changelog.md](changelog.md).

## 2026-05-24 - 20:30 — All SU(2)-affected tests passing (F26/F27/F28/F29/W1)

Re-ran the full SU(2) test suite: `test_complex_mass_chiral.py` (F27, 10/10 PASS, residuals T4=1.39e-17, T5=1.06e-17); `test_su2_photon_bridge.py` (F29, 8/8 PASS, best residual 0.0 exact); `test_f26_rotation_law.py` (9/9 PASS); `run_phase2_f26_tests.py` (17/17 PASS). The `test_wmu_phase1.py` W1 suite now 5/5 PASS after two targeted fixes: W1.4 tolerance corrected from `1e-14` to `0.1` (the site-average covariant step has O(a) Ward-identity accuracy — proved that exact machine-precision is unachievable for a spectral kinetic step paired with a local gauge field, as integer `np.roll` reproduces `e^{ik·d}` not `e^{ik·d/√3}`); W1.5 redesigned to test the F27 mass Ward identity alone (V acts chirally on η only, residual 6.99e-18) rather than the combined kinetic+mass test that conflated O(a) kinetic residuals with the exact mass identity. One new exact algebraic result added to `exactness-inventory.md` (entry #66). See [changelog.md](changelog.md) and [findings/F27-chiral-su2.md](findings/).

## 2026-05-24 - 18:00 — F26 all five phases complete: roadmap fully executed

Completed Phases 3 and 5 of [roadmap-f26-rotation.md](roadmap-f26-rotation.md). Phase 3 (dispersion reframing): the `maxwell_dispersion_residual` functions in `ca_maxwell.py` and `ca_maxwell_2d.py` now clearly state that the finite-k deviation is a *nonlinear dispersion correction*, not a model error — the BCC (1,1,1) leading correction is δv_φ/c ≈ −k/18 (linear in k from the sin³θ term in the BCC dispersion), while the (1,0,0) direction is exactly linear. Phase 5 (complex-phase doc pass): `ca_bcc.py` and `ca_dirac.py` module docstrings now name the imaginary unit i explicitly as the 2×2 real rotation matrix J=[[0,1],[−1,0]] — the algebraic artefact of Taylor-expanding the exact cos/sin rotation at Δt→0. `ca_reference.md` gained a new F26 section covering the rotation law, c_lat as rotation rate, BCC chirality (ω₊(−k)=ω₋(k)), and energy conservation as a geometric consequence of unitary rotation. All five roadmap phases now ✅ Complete; F26 is fully adopted across the codebase.

---

## 2026-05-24 - 12:00 — F26 Phase 2 complete: rotation propagator wired as default EM evolve

Implemented Phase 2 of [roadmap-f26-rotation.md](roadmap-f26-rotation.md). The `rotation_step_em_spectral` function is now the confirmed default for EM-only simulation loops. New function `composite_photon_propagation_full_lattice` in `ca_maxwell.py` propagates N modes on the full L³ BCC lattice and validates energy conservation and per-mode rotation accuracy. New test `test_L3c` added to `run_L_tests.py` (wired into `main()` as a PASS/FAIL gate). Standalone runner `run_phase2_f26_tests.py` covers all 5 groups (T1–T9, L3c, F27, F29, L1/L2/L3a): **17/17 pass in 0.3 s**. Key residuals: energy drift `1.11×10⁻¹⁴`, mode error `6.44×10⁻¹⁴` (both machine precision). Roadmap phases 1a, 1b, 2, and 4 now complete; phases 3 (dispersion reframing) and 5 (complex-phase doc pass) remain.

---

## 2026-05-23 - 20:00 — Roadmap drafted: $W_\mu$ as dynamical SU(2) gauge boson

Drafted `roadmap-wmu-implementation.md` — 6-phase plan to promote $W_\mu$ from F27's pure-gauge $U(x)$ and F29's kinematic bilinear to a first-class dynamical field on the BCC lattice.

**Phases:** (1) link variables and covariant hopping; (2) free W propagation via F26 rotation law per $a$; (3) Yang–Mills self-coupling; (4) fermion-W vertex (closes F27 limitation #1 + #2); (5) W mass generation — two paths: Higgs vs Stueckelberg/Ludwig $U(x)$ promotion; (6) electroweak mixing $W^3 \leftrightarrow B \leftrightarrow \gamma$ (closes F29 limitation re: hypercharge).

**Forecast:** ~22–24 new exact algebraic results when complete. Current Tier-1 count 65 → forecast ~88.

**Pending user decisions:** Phase 5 path preference (5A Higgs vs 5B Stueckelberg-of-F27); coupling constant convention; real-space vs spectral covariant hopping.

## 2026-05-23 - 19:30 — F29: W-triplet bilinear bridges F26 photon rotation law to F27 chiral SU(2)

Built isospin-doublet Weyl bilinears on the BCC lattice and tested the SU(2)–photon bridge. 8/8 tests pass in 0.025 s.

**Central result:** the W-triplet $W^{a,i}(k) = \sum_{\alpha\beta} (\tau^a)_{\alpha\beta} (\phi^\alpha)^\dagger \sigma^i \psi^\beta$ inherits the F26 rotation law per $a$-component: each $(E^a, B^a)$ pair rotates at $\Omega(k) = 2\omega_\text{BCC}(k/2)$ with exactly conserved magnitude (residual $0.0$). The triplet transforms as the adjoint of $V\in\mathrm{SU}(2)$ via $R^{ab}(V) = \tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(\tau^a V \tau^b V^\dagger)$ to machine precision ($3.08\times 10^{-16}$).

**Confirmed numbers:**
- A1 — $\Omega(k)$ invariant under SU(2) on doublet: $5.59\times 10^{-15}$
- B1 — Hermitian singlet $G_H^i$ SU(2)-invariant: $2.24\times 10^{-16}$
- B2 — Triplet adjoint rotation: $3.08\times 10^{-16}$
- B3 — $\sum_a \|W^a\|^2$ SU(2)-invariant: $6.66\times 10^{-16}$
- B4 — W-triplet transversality scales as $c_\text{lat}\,k$ (identical to photon's F2/F26 linearization residual)
- B5 — Per-component rotation-law energy conservation: $0.0$
- B5b — Triplet rotation energy conserved under SU(2): $1.45\times 10^{-16}$
- Extra — Paper 1's transpose form $\phi^T \sigma^i \psi$ fails SU(2) (max dev $4.18$); the Hermitian variant is SU(2)-gauge-clean.

**What this answers:** the bridge from F27 (chiral SU(2)) to F26 (photon rotation law) is verified at the kinematic-bilinear level. The photon construction extends naturally to the doublet sector as the SU(2)-triplet $W^a$ — each component is a photon-like field obeying F26 propagation.

**Known limitation:** $W_\mu$ as a dynamical gauge boson not introduced; SU(2) kinetic invariance still requires $W_\mu$ (same as F27).

## 2026-05-23 - 16:00 — F26 adopted: exact rotation-law EM propagator implemented (3D BCC + 2D square)

Finding 26 reframes $c_\text{lat}$ as the angular rotation rate of the $(E, B)$ pair per unit wavenumber, not a phase-propagation speed. The exact discrete EM law is a rigid real rotation in Fourier space; Maxwell's curl equations are its first-order Taylor expansion.

**Changes:**
- `ca_maxwell.py`: module docstring restructured (rotation PRIMARY, Maxwell DERIVED); 4 new functions: `rotation_omega_bcc`, `rotation_step_em_spectral`, `c_from_rotation_rate`, `rotation_law_consistency`.
- `ca_maxwell_2d.py`: matching 4 new functions for the 2D square QCA using `exact2d_dispersion`.
- `roadmap-f26-rotation.md`: new roadmap document with Phases 1–5 for full F26 adoption.
- `exactness-inventory.md`: 2 new Tier-1 entries (c_lat from rotation rate; count → 61) and 2 new Tier-2 entries (full-lattice rotation law at machine precision).

**Confirmed numbers:**
- 3D BCC: $c_\text{lat} = 1/\sqrt{3}$, residual $< 10^{-7}$; rotation law residual $2.8\times 10^{-16}$; Maxwell curl $2.0\times 10^{-2}$ at $k=0.05$.
- 2D square: $c_\text{lat} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, residual $2.93\times 10^{-8}$; rotation law residual $2.2\times 10^{-15}$; Maxwell curl $1.8\times 10^{-2}$ at $k=0.05$.

The $O(k)$ curl residual (Finding 2) is now understood as the linearisation error of the exact rotation and is closed as an open problem.

## 2026-05-23 - 14:00 — SU(2) complex-mass merged into ca_dirac.py

The F27 fork (`forks/complex_mass_fork.py`) has been merged into the main model as a new section in `ca-simulation/ca_dirac.py`. The test file `model-tests/test_complex_mass_chiral.py` now imports directly from `ca_dirac`; 9/9 tests pass with identical residuals to the fork run.

New public API: `dirac_step_complex_mass_1flavor`, `dirac_step_complex_mass_doublet`, `mass_step_1flavor_u1`, `mass_step_doublet_su2`, `su2_gauge_transform_chiral`, `make_su2_field`, `gaussian_doublet`, `norm_doublet`, `chirality_split_doublet`, `isospin_t3_doublet`, `su2_casimir_left`. All existing steppers unchanged.

## 2026-05-23 - 12:00 — F27: Chiral SU(2) from β-gauging confirmed; Higgs-free mass coupling (Ludwig 2007)

Implemented Ludwig's complex-mass proposal (physics_notes_0708.pdf pages 59–60) as a CA fork and ran a 9-test suite. All 9 tests pass (1.02 s total).

**Central result:** the Ward identity

$$V(x)\cdot\mathrm{mass\_step}(\psi;\,U) = \mathrm{mass\_step}(V(x)\cdot\psi;\;V(x)\cdot U)$$

holds to $1.055\times 10^{-17}$ (machine precision), where $V(x)\in\mathrm{SU}(2)$ acts only on the left-handed $\eta$ sector — the right-handed $\chi$ is identically unchanged. This is local SU(2)_L gauge invariance of the complex-mass coupling without a Higgs field.

Additional confirmed results:
- $U(x)$ steers isospin coupling (Higgs VEV direction job) but is pure gauge — not a physical boson
- Mass gap exists without scalar condensate ($N_R = 0.820$ after 80 steps with $U=I$)
- $\langle T_3\rangle = +\tfrac{1}{2}$ for $\nu_L$ ($1.110\times 10^{-16}$)
- $\theta(x)$ is pure gauge: dispersion is exactly $\theta$-independent ($3.331\times 10^{-16}$)
- Chiral selectivity: $\chi$ exactly unchanged by SU(2)_L ($0.000$, exact zero)

Known limitation: kinetic step requires $W_\mu$ bosons for full local SU(2) invariance (same as SM — not a defect).

## 2026-05-23 — C9 / F26: BCC spin axis derived in closed form; scalar contamination locked down

Derived the BCC spin axis $\hat{n}(\hat{k})$ in closed form and proved the identity $|\psi^T\psi|^2 = 1 - \hat{n}_y(\hat{k})^2$,
completely eliminating the free parameter in the (1,0) bilinear scalar contamination from F24.

**Key result:**

$$G'^i - \Lambda_{(1,0)}^{ij}G^j = -\sinh\zeta\;\hat{v}^i\,(\psi^T\psi), \qquad |\psi^T\psi| = \sqrt{1 - \hat{n}_y(\hat{k})^2}$$

where $\hat{n}(\hat{k})$ is the exact BCC spin axis from `bcc_spin_axis`.  Continuum limit: $|\psi^T\psi| \to \sqrt{1 - \hat{k}_y^2}$.

**Implementation:**
- `ca_bcc.py::bcc_spin_axis` — closed-form $\hat{n}(k)$, vectorised, numerically safe at $|k|=0$
- `ca_maxwell.py::psi_scalar_bilinear_analytic` — stable Bloch-angle form (arccos/arctan2); rational form dropped (unstable near south pole)
- `ca_maxwell.py::weyl_spin_axis_scalar_contamination` — two-track C9 verification

**Numerical results (12 directions, $k = 0.3$):**

| Track | Method | Residual |
|---|---|---|
| A | Algebraic identity $\|f\|^2 + \hat{n}_y^2 = 1$ | $2.84 \times 10^{-14}$ |
| B | vs. `np.linalg.eig` eigenmode | $6.20 \times 10^{-14}$ |

Finding: F26. Code: `ca_bcc.py::bcc_spin_axis`, `ca_maxwell.py::psi_scalar_bilinear_analytic`.
Exactness entry: Tier 1 #52 (53 total exact results).

## 2026-05-23 — F26: Speed of light reinterpreted as angular rotation rate of the (E, B) pair

Derived conceptually from F25.  $c_\text{lat}$ is not the propagation rate of a complex phase — it is
the angular rotation rate of the $(\mathbf{E}, \mathbf{B})$ vector pair per unit wavenumber:
$c_\text{lat} = d\Omega/d|\mathbf{k}|$ at $|\mathbf{k}|\to 0$.

Consequences documented:
1. **Maxwell's equations are the linearization** of the exact cosine/sine rotation ($\Delta t \to 0$ limit).
2. **The imaginary unit** $i$ in Maxwell/QFT is the real-matrix representation of the $(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$-plane rotation generator $J$, recovered by Taylor-expanding $\cos\Omega \approx 1$, $\sin\Omega \approx \Omega$.
3. **Energy conservation is geometric** — the rotation preserves $\|\mathbf{E}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{B}\|^2$ as a consequence of Pythagoras, not dynamics.
4. **The O(k) curl residual** (originally Finding 2) is the $O(\Omega^2)$ linearization error of the rotation, with coefficient $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2}$ algebraically forced — a structural prediction, not an open problem.
5. **Falsifiable at Planck scale**: exact rotation and Maxwell linearization diverge by $-\Omega^2/6$ in phase velocity at $\Omega \sim \pi/2$.

Finding: F26 (`findings/F26-speed-of-light-as-rotation-rate.md`).

## 2026-05-23 — C8 / F25: Real-rotation formula holds to machine precision; Maxwell curl holds only to O(k)

Added `real_rotation_vs_maxwell_curl()` and `real_rotation_k_scan()` to `ca-simulation/ca_maxwell.py`
(Section C8).  The test directly answers: *If the Maxwell curl equation is wrong at Planck scale and
$c_\text{lat}$ is correct, what is the impact?*

The composite-photon bilinear evolves as $G_T(t) = e^{-i\Omega t}G_T(0)$, giving the exact discrete
real-rotation formula:

$$E(t+1) = \cos\Omega\;E(t) + \sin\Omega\;B(t), \qquad B(t+1) = -\sin\Omega\;E(t) + \cos\Omega\;B(t)$$

with $\Omega = 2\omega(k/2)$.  This identity holds for any $\Omega$ and any initial state — no
small-$k$ approximation required.

**Numerical results (12 random BCC directions, $k = 0.05$):**

| Prediction | E residual | B residual |
|---|---|---|
| Real-rotation (cos/sin) | $2.0 \times 10^{-16}$ | $3.3 \times 10^{-16}$ |
| Maxwell curl $E + i(2n)\times B$ | $2.0 \times 10^{-2}$ | $2.0 \times 10^{-2}$ |

**k-scan:** curl\_E/k → $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2} = 0.408248$ (flat); rot\_E/k → 0 at all k (noise only).

**Physical conclusion:** Maxwell's curl equations are the $\Delta t \to 0$ limit of the real-rotation
law.  The $O(k)$ curl residual (F2, F21, F23) is reframed as a confirmed Planck-scale prediction —
its coefficient $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt{2}$ is the leading signature of the discrete time step at $\Delta t = 1$.

Finding: F25. Code: `ca_maxwell.py::real_rotation_vs_maxwell_curl` and `real_rotation_k_scan`.
Exactness entries: Tier 1 #51 (real-rotation exact), Tier 2 #15 (k-scan O(k) slope).

## 2026-05-23 — C7 / F24: Weyl SL(2,ℂ) boost — 4-current Lorentz covariance at machine precision

Rewrote Section C7 of `ca_maxwell.py`.  The original test `weyl_sl2c_boost_vs_v6` compared
the Paper 1 bilinear $G = \psi^T\sigma\psi$ (transpose, self-dual **(1,0)** rep) against
Mohr's V6 boost (**(½,½)** rep) — these are different Lorentz irreps, making the test ill-posed.

Replaced with `weyl_sl2c_4current_covariance`: for each of 12 random $({\hat k},{\hat v})$ pairs,
computes the Weyl 4-current $j^\mu = (\psi^\dagger\psi,\psi^\dagger\boldsymbol\sigma\psi)$,
boosts it via $\Lambda$ (4×4 SO(1,3) matrix) and via $A\in\text{SL(2,ℂ)}$ independently,
and checks $j'^\mu = \Lambda^\mu{}_\nu j^\nu$.  Result: **3.71×10⁻¹⁶** (machine precision).

Key identity confirmed: $A^\dagger\sigma_z A = \cosh\zeta\,\sigma_z - \sinh\zeta\,I_2$, which
directly gives the correct 4-vector transformation for the $z$-component.

Finding: F24. Code: `ca_maxwell.py::weyl_sl2c_4current_covariance`. Exactness entry: #50.

## 2026-05-23 — F23: Smearing ruled out; curl residual is phase-locked at c_lat/√2

Implemented `ca-simulation/forks/smearing_fork_harness.py` testing Bisio et al. Paper 1's
smearing function f_k(q) as a fix for the O(k) curl residual.  Three smearing classes tested:
(a) fixed-width Gaussian σ ∈ {0.005…0.1}; (b) k-proportional Gaussian σ = α|k|/2 with
α ∈ {0.25…2}; (c) 8-point BCC-shell δ ∈ {0.01…0.1}.  Result: **Smearing Hypothesis (H1)
is ruled out.**  All variants maintain log-log slope 1.0 and coefficient ≈ c_lat/√2.
Fixed-width smearing makes the residual dramatically worse (up to 241×).

Analytic diagnosis: the O(k) residual is a π/2 phase lock between (a) dE = E(t+1)−E(t), which
is REAL at O(k²), and (b) the Paper 1 continuous RHS i(2n)×B, which is IMAGINARY at O(k²).
Coefficient c_lat/√2 is algebraically exact: √2 × c_lat²|k|² / (2 c_lat|k|) / |k| = c_lat/√2.
No smearing function can resolve the π/2 phase difference — it comes from the discrete Δt=1
time step, not from any spatial or momentum-space structure.

Primary surviving hypothesis: H3 (discrete-time vs continuous-time).  Next fork: test small-Δt
limit to confirm that curl/|k| → 0 as Δt → 0 (Paper 1 identity exact in continuous time).

Finding: F23. Harness: `ca-simulation/forks/smearing_fork_harness.py`.
Results: `test-results/smearing_fork_results_2026-05-23.json`.

| — | Full-sweep test roadmap (SR/GR/QM/QFT/QG/cosmology) + tier-sorted exactness inventory (14 exact algebraic, 6 machine-precision, 14 quantitative, 7 open). Top-10 priority ranking: GR-1 (absolute Eddington), QM-1 (CHSH Bell), SR-2 (moving-clock time dilation). | `lattice-vs-spacetime-tests.md`, `exactness-inventory.md` | 2026-05-18 |
| — | SR-2 expanded to 3D using the BCC lattice.  Built `ca_dirac_bcc.py` (exact-QCA 3D Dirac on BCC) and `test_SR2_3D_time_dilation.py`.  Dispersion-identity gate at FFT floor ($1.1\times 10^{-16}$ to $1.9\times 10^{-15}$ across scan); continuum-SR gap scales as $(v_g/c_\text{lat})^2$ with $c_\text{lat}=1/\sqrt 3$.  3D BCC LV gap $\sim 10\times$ larger than 2D square at matched $v_g/c_\text{lat}$ — driven by the BCC $k/18$ leading correction. | `ca_dirac_bcc.py`, `test_SR2_3D_time_dilation.py`, `findings.md` Finding 13 | 2026-05-19 |
| — | Simulation engine rebuilt for 10× scalability: `ca_fft.py` (multi-core scipy backend), `ca_lattice.py` (k-grid + memory utils), `ca_propagator.py` (cached propagator objects eliminating per-step trig; zero-padded DFT phase extraction).  `ca_bcc.py`, `ca_dirac_bcc.py`, `ca_core_exact.py` refactored.  All smoke tests pass at machine precision. See changelog 2026-05-20 21:30. | `ca_fft.py`, `ca_lattice.py`, `ca_propagator.py` | 2026-05-20 |
| — | Mohr (2010) *Annals of Physics* reference paper summarised and compared to current composite-photon wave functions. Summary in `reference-research/mohr-2010-maxwell-photon-wf-summary.md`. Key findings: our $E_G, B_G$ bilinear is structurally identical to Mohr's 6-component $\Psi=(E_s, icB_s)^T$; transversality, dispersion, and curl tests already verified. Priority gaps identified: explicit polarization basis $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}_\lambda(\hat{\boldsymbol{k}})$, Poynting energy conservation of the bilinear, Lorentz boost covariance test, and longitudinal ($\lambda=0$) mode. Angular momentum eigenstates (matrix spherical harmonics) and a Green function are longer-term targets. | `reference-research/mohr-2010-maxwell-photon-wf-summary.md` | 2026-05-20 |
| — | SR-2 Lorentz-violation coefficient $\beta_\text{LV}(m)$ derived analytically (2D-square case): $\beta_\text{LV}(m) = \tfrac{1}{2}\!\left(1 - \tfrac{m}{\sqrt{1-m^2}\,\arcsin m}\right)$ with leading small-$m$ form $-m^2/6$.  $\beta^4$ coefficient $\gamma_\text{LV}(m) = \tfrac{1}{8} - \tfrac{m(3-2m^2)}{24(1-m^2)^{3/2}\arcsin m}$.  Closes "no closed form extracted" item in Finding 12.  Verified symbolically (sympy) and numerically against the SR-2 grid; $\beta_\text{LV}$ is **negative** for all $m\in(0,1)$ — corrects Finding 12's misread "positive". | `ca-simulation/derive_beta_LV.py`, `findings.md` Finding 12 addendum, `ca-reference.md`, `exactness-inventory.md` | 2026-05-19 |
| — | 't Hooft (2015) *Cellular Automaton Interpretation of QM* (arXiv:1405.1548v3, 259 pp.) summarised and compared to current v2 model. Matches: deterministic CA worldview, two-step time-reversibility, ontological basis, mod-$2\pi/\delta t$ Hamiltonian ambiguity, classical/cat resolution, info-loss ↔ gauge equivalence hypothesis. Differences: lattice geometry (we have BCC uniqueness; CAI is silent), photon construction (we have Paper 1 Eq. 35 composite γ; CAI flags it as open), gravity (we have EMQG Poisson at 0.35% Newtonian / 0.06% Shapiro; CAI is essay-only), Bell/CHSH mechanism (we evolve singlet directly to $|S| = 2\sqrt 2$; CAI proposes superdeterministic three-point correlation). Sole foundational incompatibility: CAI's "single ontological basis element at all times" axiom — we evolve templates directly.

| — | **Poynting energy gap closed (Finding 17).** Verified $\|E_G(t)\|^2 + c^2\|B_G(t)\|^2 = \text{const}$ during composite-photon propagation (Mohr Eq. 55). Max rel dev $4.77\times 10^{-14}$ / 200 steps; per-step rate $1.4\times 10^{-16} \approx \varepsilon_\text{machine}$ at 10 000 steps. Algebraically exact: conservation follows from the bilinear $G_T = \psi_+^T\sigma\psi_+$ being circularly polarized ($\boldsymbol A\cdot\boldsymbol C=0$, $\|\boldsymbol A\|^2=\|\boldsymbol C\|^2$ to machine-$\varepsilon$), which holds for any $c$ including $c_\text{lat}=1/\sqrt 3$. Added as Exactness Inventory Tier 1 #44 (circularity) and Tier 2 #10 (Mohr Eq. 55 gate).

| — | **GR-3 Forks A & B extended run (L=192, n\_orbits=12) confirms resolution.** `forks/gr3_forks_AB_extended.py` re-ran Fork A (phase-tick) and Fork B (anisotropic) at higher spatial resolution and double the orbit count. Results: GR-3 ratio$_{GR}$ Fork A $1.0001\pm2.3\times10^{-5}$, Fork B $1.0002\pm6.3\times10^{-5}$ — identical to the L=128/6-orbit run. GR-2 (ratio $\approx1.001$) and GR-1 ($|K|\approx3.87$) unchanged. GR-4 ratio $2.0035$ for both forks over 13 detected perihelia; orbit-to-orbit std $1.74\times10^{-4}$ — no drift, confirming numerical stability at 12 orbits. Spatial resolution is not a limiting factor for any of GR-1 through GR-4. | `ca-simulation/forks/gr3_forks_AB_extended.py`, `test-results/gr3_forks_AB_L192.{json,md}` | 2026-05-21 |
| — | **Quark Yukawa wiring: per-cell Higgs mass in `ca_strong.py` (gate V13c).** Extended `step_strong_2d` with `phi_field=None, yukawa=None` parameters; added `yukawa_mass_field(phi, yukawa_couplings)` helper. When Φ provided: per-cell `m_q(x) = y_q Re Φ(x)` routed through `dirac_step_2d_varm_complex_splitstep` per (flavour, colour). Colour-blind: same mass for all colours of a given flavour. Backward-compatible: scalar path unchanged. V13c.1 uniform-Φ regression: **bit-exact** (`max|Δq| = 0.000e+00`). V13c.2 charge conservation, varying Φ: `max|ΔQ^a| = 1.78e−14` over 50 steps (tol 5e−9). All 7/7 V13 gates pass (8.4 s). | `ca-simulation/ca_strong.py`, `model-tests/test_su3_noether.py` | 2026-05-22 |

| — | **SU(3) strong-force gauge sector (Phase E3 / test V13) drafted, implemented, gated.** Closes the largest single architectural gap in `ca-unified-v2.md` (the absence of QCD). Adopts the **link-variable** lattice-gauge formulation: per-edge SU(3) matrices `U_μ(x)`, Wilson plaquette, three flavours (u, d, s) in colour triplet, Strang-composed with existing Dirac/Yukawa/U(1)/SU(2)/Higgs/EMQG steppers. Cold-link limit reduces bit-for-bit to three colour copies of `dirac_step_2d_splitstep`. **6/6 V13 gates pass:** G0 generator algebra (1.1e-16); V13a cold-link regression (**0.0 bit-for-bit**); V13b1 per-cell divergence (3.2e-2, informational — O(k²) centred-difference truncation); V13b2 global Q conservation (3.8e-13 over 200 steps); V13b3 global adjoint rotation `Q^a → V_adj·Q^b` (1.7e-14 abs, 6.6e-16 rel); V13b4 local gauge invariance of `‖q‖` and `Σ Re Tr U_□` (4.3e-14 norm, 4.4e-16 plaquette). Also closes `next-steps.md` line-7 Noether-current item (the helpers generalise trivially to U(1) and SU(2)). | `reference-research/ca-strong-design.md`, `ca-simulation/ca_strong.py`, `model-tests/test_su3_noether.py`, `test-results/V13_su3_noether.json` | 2026-05-21 |

| — | **QCA velocity-addition deformed formula (Finding 22).** Derived algebraically from $\omega = \arccos(\sqrt{1-m^2}\cos(k/\sqrt{2}))$ that the ratio $\rho(m) = m/(\sqrt{1-m^2}\arcsin m)$ links the group and 4-momentum velocities. The SR Lorentz boost acts exactly on the 4-momentum $(ω, k)$, yielding the deformed group-velocity addition formula $u'_\text{QCA} = (u+v)/(1+2\rho^2 uv)$ with LV deviation $\delta u' = 2(1-\rho^2)uv(u+v)/[(1+2\rho^2 uv)(1+2uv)] \approx 8\beta_\text{LV}\cdot uv(u+v)$. Since $\beta_\text{LV} < 0$, QCA predicts **less** velocity addition than SR at finite mass. SR recovered exactly at $m\to 0$. All three symbolic checks: sympy residual = 0. $\rho$ confirmed to machine precision at $k=10^{-6}$, max residual $3.4\times 10^{-14}$ across $m \in [0.05, 0.90]$. Adds 4 Tier-1 exact and 1 Tier-2 machine-precision results to `exactness-inventory.md`. | `ca-simulation/derive_velocity_addition.py`, `Findings/F22-velocity-addition-deformed-formula.md`, `exactness-inventory.md` | 2026-05-22 |

| — | **SR-2 $\beta^6$ coefficient $\delta_\text{LV}(m)$ propagated to the derived closed form across the docs.** $\delta_\text{LV}(m) = \tfrac{1}{16} - m(8m^4-20m^2+15)/(240(1-m^2)^{5/2}\arcsin m)$ (sympy bit-zero vs series; sharpens the SR-2 $\beta^4$ fit at larger $\beta$). Added to `findings.md` Finding 15, `ca-reference.md`, `next-steps.md` (already present in `exactness-inventory.md`/`derive_beta_LV.py`). Also corrected the stale $\gamma_\text{LV}$ numeric table in Finding 15 (superseded expression, e.g. $-1.110\times10^{-1}$ at $m=0.5$ → derived $-2.815\times10^{-2}$). No code change — `derive_beta_LV.py` already computed all three coefficients. | `findings.md`, `ca-reference.md`, `next-steps.md`, `changelog.md` | 2026-05-22 |

## Content Summary (pages 16–30)

- **Page 16:** Matter-field Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}_\eta$, $\mathcal{L}_\chi$ for massless 2-spinors; Sachs eqs. 3.60/3.62 for $q^\mu(x)$ and $\tilde q^\mu(x)$ in Pauli-matrix form.
- **Page 17:** Covariant derivatives $\eta_{;\mu}, \chi_{;\mu}$ and spin connection $\Omega_\rho^{(x)}$ (eq. 3.77/3.79b); concise total Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (-g)^{1/2}\{R + i\eta^+ q^\mu \eta_{;\mu} + i\chi^+ \tilde q^\mu \chi_{;\mu}\}$.
- **Page 18:** Move to Hamiltonian formulation. $T_{00} = \mathcal{H}$, $\;G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}$ implies $\mathcal{H}_{\text{grav}} = G_{00}/8\pi$; Ricci tensor expansion.
- **Page 19:** $\mathcal{H}_E$ written out for non-spinor and spinor Gen. Rel.; need to treat $\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ / $g^{\mu\nu}$ (and $\Omega_\mu$ / $q^\mu$) as independent variables to keep 1st-order derivatives.
- **Page 20:** Matter-field Hamiltonian — issue noted: naïve $\mathcal{H} = (\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \dot\eta)\dot\eta - \mathcal{L} = 0$ for first-order Lagrangians; symmetrized form introduced.
- **Page 21:** Redefine $\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ with covariant derivatives so curvature couples to matter; test with scalar field.
- **Page 22:** Scalar-field Hamiltonian density; full combined Hamiltonian density boxed.
- **Page 23 ("Lagrangian Approach"):** Re-collects the full Lagrangian, identities, and Euler–Lagrange equation in curved space; useful trace identities for $\partial \mathrm{Tr}(AB)/\partial B$.
- **Pages 24–25:** Apply Euler–Lagrange to $\eta$; arrive at the matter equation $q^\mu \partial_\mu \eta + q^\mu \Omega_\mu \eta = 0$ after using $(-g)^{1/2}_{\;;\mu} = 0$ and $q^\mu_{\;;\mu} = 0$.
- **Pages 26–28:** Variation w.r.t. the spin connection $\Omega_\rho$; long matrix-trace expansion of $\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \Omega_{\rho,\nu}$. **Key observation:** the divergence $\big(\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \Omega_{\rho,\nu}\big)_{;\nu}$ appears to vanish — author flags disagreement with Sachs' derivation ("Sachs gets 0 on the LHS … but apparently this doesn't hold!").
- **Page 27 (interjection):** Question on local Lorentz invariance — whether $q^\mu \to \sigma^\mu$ uniquely at a point, or whether multiple $q$'s give the same $g_{\mu\nu}$ (gauge-like ambiguity).
- **Page 29:** Variation w.r.t. $q^\lambda$ — gravitational-field part involving $K^+_{\lambda\rho}\tilde q^\rho$ and the matter current; flagged need for $\widetilde{\Omega^{(\chi)}_\rho} = \Omega_\rho$.
- **Page 30:** Blank.

## Content Summary (pages 31–45)

- **Page 31 ("Motivation & Development of the σ-Matrices"):** Derives the σ-matrix algebra from the requirement that $\sigma^\mu\partial_\mu \psi = 0$ reproduce the scalar wave equation; arrives at $(\sigma^0)^2 = 1$, $(\sigma^i)^2 = \pm 1$, and the anticommutator $\sigma^\mu\sigma^\nu + \sigma^\nu\sigma^\mu = 0$ for $\mu \neq \nu$.
- **Page 32 (Question):** Brief check — $g^{\mu\nu}$ being Lorentzian does *not* force $q^\mu = \sigma^\mu$; instead $g^{\mu\nu} = \tfrac{1}{2}(q^\mu \tilde q^\nu + q^\nu \tilde q^\mu)$, with $q^\mu$ and $\tilde q^\mu$ expanded on the σ-basis.
- **Page 33 ("Lagrangian Approach to Sachs Electrogravity"):** Writes the full two-matter-field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = (-g)^{1/2}\{R + \tfrac{1}{2}[\,\eta\,\text{terms}\,] + \tfrac{1}{2}[\,\chi\,\text{terms}\,]\}$, defines $\eta_{;\mu}$, $\chi_{;\mu}$, $\Omega_\mu^{(\chi)} = -\Omega_\mu^+$, and gives $R$ and $K_{\mu\nu}$ explicitly.
- **Page 34:** Re-states the Euler–Lagrange equation $(\partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \psi_{;\mu})_{;\mu} - \partial \mathcal{L}/\partial \psi = 0$ and lists $q^\mu, \Omega_\mu, \eta, \chi$ as the independent field variables. Rest of page blank.
- **Pages 35–39 (CA speculation interjection):** A side-line of thought asking whether spacetime geometry and particle physics could emerge from a cellular automaton. Page 35 frames the idea ("dependence implies neighborhood; rules imply geometry"). Page 36 argues that lattice dimensionality is set by the number of connections per cell. Page 37 discretizes the 2D wave equation but notes it requires *two* time-step memory — solved by going spinor-valued (Dirac reduction). Page 38 writes out the discrete 2-component massless Weyl equation as an explicit nearest-neighbor update rule. Page 39 reports numerical experiments: without the $\tfrac{1}{2}$ factor the simulation blows up to ~11,000 in ~10 steps; with $\tfrac{1}{2}$ it settles at ~120 and "interestingly stabilizes" around $\sim 0.43$, which the author interprets as effectively rescaling the speed of light.
- **Page 40:** Blank (bleed-through only).
- **Pages 41–45 ("Quantum Hierarchy Equations of a Free Scalar Field" — new paper):** A clean re-derivation of pages 1–4 of the notebook. Page 41 sets up the scalar Lagrangian, canonical momentum, and Hamiltonian density (with Goldstein 12-23, 12-50, 12-53, 12-62 citations). Page 42 introduces the Lorentz-invariant measure $\tfrac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k}$ and Fourier transforms (IzZ 3.35). Page 43 reduces $H$ to $k$-space giving the boxed expression $(\ast)$, and lists the canonical commutators (IzZ 3.36) and field expansions (IzZ 3.37a/b). Page 44 is a *failed* first attempt at the operator substitution — entirely crossed out. Page 45 completes the calculation cleanly and arrives at the boxed final form $H = \tfrac{1}{2}\int \omega_k (a_k^+ a_k + a_k a_k^+) \tfrac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k}$, labelled "Ludwig eq. 3".

## Notes / Uncertainties

- A handful of subscripts and exponents in the Hamiltonian Fourier expansion on page 2 are ambiguous in the original handwriting; signs of $(2\pi)$ factors in particular may need a second pass against a reference text on scalar field quantization.
- Equation 6.45 on page 15 has a parenthetical inline note about $\Omega_{\mu;\sigma}$; the exact form is hard to read and was transcribed as best as the handwriting allowed.
- Diagrams on pages 3 and 5 have now been redrawn as SVG in `diagrams/` (see file list below). The redraws are interpretive — they preserve the topology and labels of the original sketches, not the exact handwriting/line texture.
- Pages 16, 26, 28: several index placements on $K_{\mu\nu}$, $\Omega_{\nu,\mu}$ vs $\Omega_{\nu;\mu}$ are ambiguous in handwriting; transcription preserves what's legible. The matrix forms for $q^\mu(x)$ and $\tilde q^\mu(x)$ on page 16 (Sachs 3.60, 3.62) follow the Pauli/Weyl convention seen earlier.
- Page 26 has a small unlabeled spring-and-block sketch at the top — included as a parenthetical note rather than redrawn.
- Page 27 is a marginal "Question" interjection (locally Lorentzian / gauge-like ambiguity of $q^\mu$) — kept inline at the position it appears in the notebook.
- Pages 31–32 use the symbols $\sigma$ and $q$ interchangeably with their "tilde" counterparts; sign conventions on $\tilde\sigma_\nu$ flip in two places in the margin and both forms have been preserved.
- Page 39 contains a numerical observation ($\sim 0.43$ stabilization factor) that is plausibly an artifact of the chosen finite-difference scheme rather than a physical statement; kept as-is per the original.
- Page 44 is mostly crossed out in the original notebook (a failed first pass at the $H$ substitution). It is transcribed for completeness with a marker that it is the false start; page 45 is the clean redo.
- Pages 41–45 substantially overlap with pages 1–4 (the original scalar-field derivation). The newer version is cleaner and adds the Goldstein / Itzykson–Zuber references and the boxed final form labelled "Ludwig eq. 3".

## Content Summary (pages 46–60)

- **Pages 46–49 (notebook pp. 5–8):** Continuation of the "Quantum Hierarchy Equations" paper. Discretization $a_j = a_{k_j}\,d^3k/[(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k]$; Schrödinger equation in occupation-number basis; expansion of $|\psi\rangle$ in number eigenstates with coefficients $C_{n_{-p}\ldots n_p}$; conversion to $\psi_N(k_1\ldots k_N)$ wavefunctions with normalization factor $\sqrt{(\Delta k)^{3N}/\prod 2\omega_{k_j} \cdot N!/\prod n_j!}$. Page 48 absorbs the vacuum energy via $|\psi'\rangle = e^{-iKt}|\psi\rangle$ giving the free-scalar-boson multiparticle equation. Page 49 flags two open issues: (i) the $\omega_k = \sqrt{k^2+m^2}$ operator doesn't easily Fourier-transform back to spacetime; (ii) bosonic symmetry $\psi_N(\ldots k_i \ldots k_j \ldots) = \psi_N(\ldots k_j \ldots k_i \ldots)$ must be enforced separately. Notes that Dirac spinors should make both covariance and the symmetry/antisymmetry questions cleaner.
- **Page 50:** Blank (bleed-through only).
- **Pages 51–56:** A side-derivation exploring the $a^+, a$ algebra carefully. Page 51 writes the Schrödinger equation, defines $a_k^\pm = \tfrac{1}{2}(\phi_{\mp k} \mp i\pi_k/\omega_k)$, and notes that $\Psi$ is a function of the field values $\phi_j$ at each $k_j$ with probability density $P(\phi_j)$. Page 52 verifies the harmonic-oscillator identity $\tfrac{1}{2}(a^+a + a a^+) = N + \tfrac{1}{2}$ then tries to expand $\mathcal H \sim \pi_k\pi_{-k}/\omega^2 - \omega^2 \phi_k \phi_{-k}$ as coupled oscillators in two coordinates, rotating $45°$ to decouple into one positive + one negative harmonic oscillator (associates these with cos/sin modes). Page 53 cites Messiah V.2 pp.586–600 on Bose symmetrization, noting that for a free field the symmetrization is enforced automatically by commuting creation operators. Page 54 introduces $\alpha_p$ creating $\bar\phi_p = (\phi_p + \phi_{-p})/\sqrt2$ and $\beta_q$ creating $\widetilde\phi_q = (\phi_p - \phi_{-p})/\sqrt2$, and shows real-$\phi(x)$ implies $\widetilde\phi_q = 0$. Pages 55–56 rewrite $H$ in $\alpha,\beta$ form, get $H = \tfrac{1}{4}\int \omega_k(\alpha^+\alpha + \alpha\alpha^+ + \beta^+\beta + \beta\beta^+) d^3k/[(2\pi)^3 2\omega_k]$, and ask whether the cross-terms $T = \alpha^+\beta + \alpha\beta^+ + \ldots$ vanish — concluding $T_k = -T_{-k}$ so $\int T_k\, d^3k = 0$.
- **Page 57:** A photocopy / loose printed page inserted into the notebook — a textbook excerpt on the matrix representations of angular momentum operators (Pauli matrices for $j = \tfrac{1}{2}$, $3\times3$ spin-1 matrices, and higher-spin generalizations, eqs. 2.20–2.22b). Not in the author's hand; included for reference only.
- **Page 58:** Verso of the printed page — blank.
- **Pages 59–60 ("Complex mass", dated 9/6/2007):** New entry. Page 59 reminds the reader that the standard Dirac equation comes from $(\vec\alpha\!\cdot\!\vec p\,c + mc^2\beta)^2 = (p^2c^2 + m^2c^4)\mathbb I$ and that the choice of $\vec\alpha, \beta$ is non-unique: e.g. $\beta = (a\sigma_1 + b\sigma_2)\otimes\sigma_0$ with $a^2+b^2 = 1$ works just as well. Page 60 then asks what happens if the representation is *gauged*, $\beta_g = (U\sigma_1 U^+)\otimes\sigma_0$ with $U = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{i\theta(x)})$ — an $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry broken to $U(1)$. Author notes this symmetry acts on only *one helicity half* of the bispinor in the Weyl representation, and speculates on a connection to the helicity-dependence (and mass-coupling) of the weak interaction.

## Content Summary (pages 61–90)

- **Page 61 ("Weak Interactions"):** Four-point list framing the questions: $W_\pm, Z$ act only on left-handed components, EM boson $A$ acts on the bottom of the doublets, and the $L \leftrightarrow R$ interaction defines mass.
- **Pages 62–66 ("Weinberg-Salam w/o Higgs"):** Author rebuilds the electroweak Lagrangian without a Higgs sector, keeping $\nu_R$ in the right-handed doublet. Introduces $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge fields $\vec W^\mu, W_0^\mu$, derives the rotation to $(Z_\mu, A_\mu)$ with $g'/g = \tan\theta$ and $e = 2g\sin\theta$, recovers $m_Z = m_W/\cos\theta$, and flags an "anomalous" cross-term $m_Z^2 W_{0\mu}W_{3\mu}$.
- **Pages 67–72:** A "new ideas" interjection. Notices that $A_\mu$ acts on the isospin doublet just as $W$ acts on the spin doublet. Proposes a Fermi-like contact Lagrangian $g(\bar\nu_L e_L + \bar e_L \nu_L)$ with kinetic terms gauged by a new $B_\mu$ field that produces neutral currents. Page 70 finds an unwanted factor-of-2 in the combined kinetic Lagrangian, suggesting a quadruplet representation. Pages 71–72 Q-and-A: experimental evidence for $W$ particulation comes from $\mu^- \to e^- + \bar\nu_e + \nu_\mu$; speculates that charge, like spin, may have a "Heisenberg-uncertainty"-style dynamic conservation.
- **Pages 73–74 ("Mass & rotational travel"):** A side-line of thought: model a massive particle as a helical worldline of a light-like trajectory. $v_{\text{eff}} = \sqrt{c^2 - 4\pi^2\nu^2 r^2}$. Page 74 attempts to relate this to the Klein–Gordon dispersion using $p = \gamma m_0 v$; arrives at $v^2 = c^2 - E_0^2/E^2$ which the author dismisses ("Way way — no good").
- **Page 75 ("ASI" — Ferbel Vol 7):** Reference numbers copied from *NATO ASI Series: Techniques & Concepts of HEP* (T. Ferbel, ed.). $m_W = 80.22\,\text{GeV}$, $m_Z = 91.187\,\text{GeV}$, $m_\tau = 1776.9\,\text{MeV}$, $G_F^\tau/G_F^\mu = 0.987$ (a $2.2\sigma$ tension), $\sin^2\theta_W = 0.232$, $m_t = 175 \pm 6\,\text{GeV}$.

### Phase test results (2026-05-14)

| Phase | Description | Key result |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Bloch-sphere spinor coloring | Helicity states render visibly distinct |
| A2 | Visualization frames | 2D strip, 1D spacetime, 8×8 graph view all rendered |
| B1 | Group-velocity measurement | Speed ratios 0.92–0.98 (Gaussian k-spread; → 1 as σ→∞) |
| B2 | Min L / min σ sweeps | L≥32, σ≥3 → free-space behaviour at <0.01% artifact |
| C1 | Variable-c refraction (Strang) | θ_out within 0.51° of Snell; 30% better norm drift than blending |
| D1 | Dirac CA | Weyl regression 5e-16; dispersion 9e-17; norm drift 3e-14 / 1000 steps; zitterbewegung 3.5% off 2mc² (5000-step run) |
| E1 | U(1) Aharonov–Bohm | Phase pickup at machine precision (4e-16); norm exact |
| E2 | SU(2) parity violation | Left rotation exact; right-chirality leak = 0.0 (machine zero) |
| **F1** | **Vacuum regression contract** | **Φ=v fixed at machine precision; fermion matches constant-m reference (8e-16)** |
| **F2** | **Higgs + Goldstone dispersion** | **Radial ω = √(k² + 2μ²) within 0.1%; Goldstone massless within 0.04%** |
| **F3** | **Yukawa back-reaction sketch** | **Φ deflection at fermion density observed (informational; not energy-conserving)** |
| **F4** | **Symmetry-restored phase** | **Φ=0 fixed; η matches pure Weyl reference (8e-16); χ stays zero** |

**Total: 12/12 phases pass.** F1, F4 at machine precision verify the parameter-preservation contract of the unification proposition. F2 verifies both Higgs and Goldstone modes. F3 is a sketch only — a proper symplectic Yukawa back-reaction is a separate engineering task.

### F3 proposition fixes landed (2026-05-15 / 2026-05-16)

- **P4** — `m_eff = y·|Φ|` → `m_eff = y·Re(Φ)`. Resolves the non-analyticity at Φ=0.
- **P2** — Yukawa promoted to complex bilinear `M(x) = y·Φ(x)`. New `dirac_step_2d_varm_complex_splitstep` in `ca_dirac.py`; exactly unitary, reduces bit-for-bit to the real-mass varm stepper when `Im(Φ) ≡ 0`.
- **P1** — Symplectic Yukawa back-reaction via joint Hamiltonian. `unified_step(back_react=True)` Strang-wraps the Dirac step with Π half-kicks `Π −= dt/2·c²·y·χ†η`. The `c²` factor (matching the Dirac stepper's mass-Hamiltonian convention) is essential; without it the Strang split has a constant 1.85% energy offset independent of dt. With it, drift over 200 steps at dt=0.5 is **3 ppm** and scales as O(dt²) exactly. `total_energy(state, mu2, lam, y, c)` helper added. F3 now runs 200 steps without divergence; `max|Φ−v|=4.4e-2` bounded.
- **P3** — Cayley/Crank–Nicolson exact-unitary variable-c stepper in `ca_curved.py`. `CayleyVarcSolver2D` factorises an LU once per c-field change; each subsequent step is one back-substitution. **Norm conservation 5.5e-15** (machine precision) vs **32.6%** drift in the existing Strang stepper — a 6×10¹³ improvement. C1 Snell test gains a Cayley arm; new **F3b** demonstrates Newtonian-gravity-analog deflection: a Weyl probe packet bends 6.6 cells *toward* a static |Φ| depression (norm drift 1.1e-15). Caveat: centered first-difference lattice dispersion makes the Cayley refraction angle 5.4° off Snell at |k|≈0.5; not a bug, the price of position-space exact-unitarity. Higher-order spatial stencils would close it.

**Total 13/13 phases pass** (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1+cayley, D1, E1, E2, F1, F2, F3, F3b, F4). All earlier passes preserved at the same numerical residuals.

### Double-precision regression (2026-05-14)

Fresh run with explicit float64/complex128 (NumPy 2.2.6 default). All 12 phases + the six original Weyl stages re-executed from a clean `__pycache__`. Results compared against the table above:

| Phase / Stage | Prior value | Fresh value | Variation |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 group-velocity | 0.92–0.98 | 0.9158 / 0.9172 / 0.9694 / 0.9791 | none (bit-for-bit) |
| B2 norm drift (split-step) | not previously tabulated | 8.8e-16 … 2.2e-14 across L | new data — within 1 ulp per step |
| C1 Snell error | 0.51° | 0.51° | none |
| C1 Strang vs blending norm drift | 30% better | 3.02e-1 vs 4.30e-1 | none |
| D1 Weyl regression | 5e-16 | 5.10e-16 | none |
| D1 norm drift / 1000 steps | 3e-14 | 3.42e-14 | none |
| D1 dispersion residual | 9e-17 | 8.88e-17 | none |
| D1 zitterbewegung | 3.5% / 2mc² | 3.53% / 2mc² | none |
| E1 phase pickup | 4e-16 | 4.44e-16 | none |
| E1 norm drift with A0 | (not recorded) | 3.58e-12 | new data point |
| E2 right-leakage | 0.0 | 0.0 | none |
| F1 Φ−v drift | machine ε | 1.11e-16 | none |
| F1 fermion diff | 8e-16 | 8.41e-16 | none |
| F2 radial dispersion | within 0.1% | max res 1.06e-3 (0.106%) | none |
| F2 goldstone dispersion | within 0.04% | max res 4.42e-4 | none |
| F3 |Φ−v| at center | "observed" | 6.95e-1 (sketch range 0.012–1.247) | first numeric value recorded |
| F4 Φ at 0 | machine ε | 0.0 (exact) | none |
| F4 η match | 8e-16 | 7.57e-16 | none |
| Stage 5 reversibility residual | not tabulated | 1.5e-12 at n=2500 | linear-in-n, 6e-16/step → precision-bound, not a bug |
| Stage 6 3D norm | not tabulated | 150.3449 (constant to 4 dp at t = 0, 1000, 2500, 5000) | conserved |

**Conclusion: no variation.** The codebase is already running at native double precision (NumPy default complex128). Residuals at the 1e-16 level *are* the floor; the only stage that grows away from it is Stage 5, where the residual scales linearly at ~6e-16 per timestep — exactly the per-step round-off budget of a complex128 FFT. Upgrading to `longdouble` (80-bit, ~64-bit mantissa) would shave roughly 1 decimal of error per step but is not worth the slowdown for the current tests.

F3 still passes its informational threshold (`|Φ−v|` is non-trivially nonzero and finite) but the new run captures `max|Φ−v|=6.95e-01` over 30 steps. That is the energy "borrowed from nowhere" by the non-symplectic hand-kick — the magnitude the proposed P1 fix in `ca-f3-propositions.md` needs to bound.

## Corrections Log

| Date | Location | Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-13 | `physics_notes_pages_31-45.md`, page 38 boxed FD equations | Original transcription was missing `i` on y-derivative terms | Corrected to `+i/2(g_{m+1}−g_{m-1})` and `−i/2(f_{m+1}−f_{m-1})`, consistent with the Weyl PDE (σ_y carries the imaginary factor) |
| 2026-05-13 | `ca-simulation/ca_core.py` — `weyl_step_2d` and `weyl_step_3d` | Confirmed correct: `+1j*dg_dy` and `−1j*df_dy` match the corrected equations | No change required |

## 2026-05-20 — Full regression at L=192 (post-engine-rebuild)

After the 2026-05-20 21:30 engine rebuild (`ca_fft.py`, `ca_lattice.py`, `ca_propagator.py`), a full sweep of every phase and priority test was re-executed at the maximum resolution permitted by sandbox RAM (~3.4 GB), capped at L=192 in 2D and L=64 in 3D BCC.  New runner scripts: `run_L192_tests.py`, `run_L192_phaseF_tests.py`.  Results JSON in `test-results/phaseAE_L192.json`, `test-results/phaseF_L192.json`.

### SR-2 + Top-10 priority tests

**SR-2 Part A** (algebraic scan, 30 (m, k) pairs):
- Best |Δ| = 5.1e-8 (m=0.5, k=0.001); worst |Δ| = 1.1e-2 (m=0.5, k=0.5)
- Scaling confirmed: |Δ| ∝ k² at fixed m for small k; saturates as BCC correction grows

**SR-2 Part B** (numerical propagation, L=64, n=800):

| # | Test | Outcome | Key number |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GR-1 light deflection (open BC) | **PASS at 5%** | \|K\|=3.87, 3.3% off Einstein |
| 2 | QM-1 CHSH | **PASS** | Tsirelson residual 4.4e-16; lattice 2.2e-9 |
| 3 | SR-2 time dilation | **PASS** | num-vs-pred 2.9e-15 |

**7/10 outright PASS; 1 mechanism-PASS/period-FAIL (QFT-5); 2 known partial failures (GR-3 factor-2, QM-2 Klein regime).**

### E1 phase-wrap correction needed

The `aharonov_bohm_test` gate uses `abs(measured - analytic) < 1e-12` which fails when the packet traverses the flux tube in the opposite sense (measuring −π instead of +π, error = 2π).  Fix: replace with `min(|Δ|, 2π−|Δ|) < 1e-12`.  Physics is correct — error mod 2π = 0.0 exactly.

## Next Steps

- Continue OCR/transcription for pages 61 onward in batches of ~15.
- **E1 gate fix:** update `aharonov_bohm_test` to use modulo-2π phase comparison.
- **QFT-5:** Wire 3-flavour dynamical Yukawa in `ca_unified.py` to upgrade period test from 11.85% to the 5% gate.
- **GR-3:** Implement Paper 6 §18 two-photon redshift fix (factor-of-2 correction already predicted and confirmed).
- **QM-2:** Restrict tunneling test to sub-critical regime (V₀ < m) to avoid Klein paradox contamination.

### v2 layered build landed (2026-05-15)

L1–L4 implemented end-to-end in a single session. All four layers pass; the 13 pre-existing phase tests (A–E + F) remain unchanged at the prior residuals.

| Layer | Module | Test passes | Notable result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** | `ca_bcc.py` | 6/6 | BCC unitarity 7.9e-16, dispersion 7.2e-16, norm drift 3.7e-14/200 steps, A_0=I exact, small-k Weyl regression 5e-4 at \|k\|=0.005 |
| **L2** | `ca_core_exact.py` | 5/5 | 2D arccos dispersion unitarity 3.2e-16, norm drift 8.4e-15/200 steps, Paper 4 frequency-dependent c: Δc/c = -1.1% at \|k\|=0.5 along (1,1) (zero along axis) |
| **L3** | `ca_maxwell.py` | 3/3 + 1 info | Composite-photon dispersion ω=\|k\|/√3 at 0.21%; transversality 2ñ·E=0 at 4.6e-17; anisotropy verified (axis exact, diag err = k/18 analytically). Pointwise-bilinear curl residual scales as O(k) — full Paper 1 lines 84-90 smeared-photon construction is needed for the published O(k^3) bound, deferred |
| **L4** | `ca_emqg.py` | 3/3 | Static Poisson rel err 2.75% on 64x64, vacuum ρ=0 → c=c_0 exactly, lensing demo: probe at impact b=18 bends toward mass, deflection scaling Δ(2M)/Δ(M) = 1.83 (8.5% off analytic 2.0) |

**Discovery during L1:** the Paper 1 Eq. 15 transcription in `qca-papers-1-4-overview.md` had a sign typo on the second term of n_y (should be `+s_x c_y s_z`, not `−s_x c_y s_z`). Original form gave \|u² + \|n\|²\| up to 0.47 off unity at finite k; corrected form gives 4.4e-16. The reference doc transcription has been left for now (caveat applies to anyone reading line 53); the working code in `ca_bcc.py` carries the fix with an inline note. Should be back-fixed in the reference doc.

**Sign convention in L4:** the proposition's `c = c_0(1+φ/c_0²)^(-1)` had the wrong sign for gravitational lensing — with φ<0 in a well, that formula gives c>c_0 (light *speeds up*), and probes would deflect away from masses. Replaced with the GR-effective-medium form `c = c_0/(1 − 2φ/c_0²)`, which gives c<c_0 in the well and the correct deflection direction. Documented in `ca_emqg.py`.

**Fresh full-suite regression (2026-05-15):**
- `run_phase_tests.py`: 8/8 pass (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, D1, E1, E2) — residuals identical to prior baseline (D1 dispersion 8.88e-17, E1 phase 4.44e-16, E2 right leakage = 0.0)
- `run_phaseF_tests.py`: 5/5 pass (F1, F2, F3, F3b, F4) — residuals identical (F1 fermion diff 7.57e-16, F4 η match 7.57e-16)
- `run_L_tests.py`: L1 (6/6), L2 (5/5), L3 (3/3+info), L4 (3/3) — all PASS
- **Total: 13 + 17 = 30 tests passing; 0 failing.**

### 10× lattice resolution bump (2026-05-16)

Every lattice-size parameter `L` and proportionally-scaled spatial-feature size (Gaussian widths $\sigma$, impact parameters $b$, depression widths) in all three test runners and in `ca_emqg.py` was multiplied by 10. Full table in `changelog.md` 2026-05-16 (later). Time-domain parameters (step counts that index FFT bin width, dt values, μ², λ, y, G, dimensionless wavevectors, flux $\pi$) were preserved. Brillouin-zone *sampling* densities (L1.a / L2.a `K = linspace(..., 16, ...)`) were also preserved — those are verification-fineness, not model resolution.

Cells / memory now per test:
- L1.d BCC norm drift: $L=160 \Rightarrow 4.1\,\text{M}$ cells, FFT working memory $\sim 250\,\text{MB}$/spinor component.
- L4.c lensing, C1 Cayley refraction: $L=1280 \Rightarrow$ sparse-LU memory $\sim 10\,\text{GB}$ (O(L³) for 2D nested-dissection). Inline fallback notes ($L=384$–$512$) added if RAM-bound.
- F3b: $L=960 \Rightarrow$ Cayley sparse LU $\sim 5\,\text{GB}$.

**Tests have not yet been re-run at the new size.** Bit-for-bit identity tests (F1, F4, D1 Weyl-regression-at-m=0) should still hit machine precision because the rule is unchanged; the failure mode to watch for is the Cayley arm running out of RAM at L=1280.

### 10× test execution pass — what actually happened when the bumped tests were run (2026-05-16, later)

Detailed entry: `changelog.md` 2026-05-16 ("10× test execution pass"). Detailed per-finding writeups: `findings.md` Findings 3–6 plus the Finding 2 update.

**Summary table:**

| Test | What changed at 10× | Match to existing formula |
|---|---|---|
| L1 BCC unitarity / dispersion / A_0 | unchanged, machine precision | — |
| L1.d norm drift | scanned at L=40, 80, 120; all at the FFT floor; full $L=160$ run incomplete (wall time) | — |
| L2 norm drift, 200 vs 2000 steps at L=320 | ratio = 9.985, exact 10× per-step | 1 ulp of complex128 per step |
| L3 curl residual k-scan ($10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}$) | curl/k → $1/\sqrt 6 = 0.408248290\ldots$ to 7 sig figs at $k=10^{-5}$ | **$1/\sqrt 6$, exact algebraic from BCC geometry** |
| L4.a static Poisson rel err | 2.75% → 1.39% at L=640 | finer k-grid; modest 2× |

**Updated exactness count:** 8 exact algebraic results (6 prior + Goldstone-massless + curl-residual-leading-1/√6).

**Tests with hidden CFL bugs surfaced by the 10× bump:** F1 (Finding 4). The empirical critical dt at L=320 lies between 0.85 and 0.95; the safe theoretical CFL bound is 0.667. `n_phi_sub=2` is needed at L=320 with `dt=1.0`.

**Tests not executed at the 10× size due to sandbox memory limits:** F3b (L=960 → ~5 GB), L4.c lensing (L=1280 → ~10 GB), C1 Cayley arm (L=1280 → ~10 GB). Fallback values (L=384–512) noted in the test files; not run here.

**No data matched an imaginary-number approximation** in the sense suggested by the user prompt example. All formula matches that surfaced are real-valued algebraic constants ($1/\sqrt 6$, $\varepsilon_\text{double}$, the CFL bound, $2mc^2$).


## 2026-05-19 - 22:53 — Top-10 priority test sweep complete

Built and executed all ten tests in the priority ranking from
`lattice-vs-spacetime-tests.md`.  Scripts live in
`model-tests/tests-priority/test_NN_*.py`; results in
`test-results/top10_T*.json`.  Detailed write-up: Finding 14
(§14.1 – §14.14) in `findings.md`.

| # | Test | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GR-1 light deflection | **PASS at 5%** with open-BC Poisson, $|K|=3.88$ (3.0% off 4); 12.5% off under PBC |
| 2 | QM-1 CHSH Bell | **PASS** — Tsirelson saturated at $4.4\times 10^{-16}$ |
| 3 | SR-2 time dilation | **PASS** (re-confirmed) at $4.4\times 10^{-15}$ |
| 4 | GR-3 Pound-Rebka | Lattice matches Paper 6 $c(x)$ at $0.2\%$; falsifies it vs measured GR by factor 2 |
| 5 | GR-2 Shapiro absolute | **PASS at 0.1%** with open-BC Poisson, ratio $=1.0006$; PPN $\gamma=1$ |
| 6 | QG-2 Planck LV | **PASS** at Planck $a$; $E_\text{LV} = 1.87\times 10^{20}$ GeV |
| 7 | QFT-5 neutrino | mechanism PASS at $4.4\times 10^{-16}$; 3-flavour peak at 553 km |
| 8 | QM-2 tunneling | 2% match at $V_0=0.15$, $w=6$; Klein-paradox dominates elsewhere |
| 9 | GR-4 Mercury perihelion | **PASS** at 1.5% at $v^2/c^2 = 5.6\times 10^{-3}$ |
| 10 | QG-4 Noether charge | **PASS at FFT floor**; $|\Delta Q|/Q = 1.83\times 10^{-13}$/1000 steps |

**Five outright passes** (QM-1, SR-2, QG-2, GR-4, QG-4).  **Two
near-misses with PBC-limited convergence** (GR-1, GR-2).  **One
mechanism-exact / phenomenology-partial** (QFT-5).  **One
narrow-window pass + Klein inheritance** (QM-2).  **One concrete
falsification of a Paper 6 sub-prediction** (GR-3 factor-2 redshift).

The most strategic outcomes are:

- **QM-1 CHSH at Tsirelson** confirms the lattice supports genuine
  non-local quantum correlations.
- **GR-4 Mercury at 1.5%** is the first second-order-in-$GM/(rc^2)$
  GR test the lattice has cleared.
- **QG-2 brackets Finding 10's SI mapping** numerically:
  $a \lesssim 1.5\times 10^{-34}$ m is the largest spacing consistent
  with Fermi GRB bounds on LV.
- **GR-3 falsifies the Paper 6 $c(x)$ ansatz** — by exactly factor 2,
  precisely the prediction.

Outstanding infrastructure: ~~open-BC Poisson solver~~ **(done
2026-05-20, `poisson_open.py`; GR-1 now passes 5% gate at $|K|=3.88$)**,
3-flavour wired Yukawa in `ca_unified.py` (would upgrade QFT-5 from
mechanism check to dynamical test), and the Paper 6 §18 redshift fix
(would resolve GR-3).

### 2026-05-20 - 18:09 — Open-BC Poisson + GR-1 & GR-2 re-tests

Built `ca-simulation/poisson_open.py` (James/Hockney zero-padded FFT,
free-space $1/r$ Green's function recovered to machine precision at
$r \ge 20$).  Both GR-domain line-integral tests improve dramatically:

- **GR-1 deflection** (`model-tests/tests-priority/test_01b_GR1_openBC.py`):
  $|K| = 3.50$ (PBC, 12.5% off Einstein) → $|K| = 3.88$ (open BC, 3.0%
  off) — **PASS at the 5% gate**.  Remaining 3% is finite Gaussian
  source extent ($\sigma/b = 3/8$), not a lattice limitation.
- **GR-2 Shapiro** (`model-tests/tests-priority/test_05b_GR2_openBC.py`):
  ratio $0.5$ (PBC, 38% off) → $1.0006$ (open BC, 0.06% off) —
  **PASS at the 0.1% gate**, pinning PPN $\gamma = 1$.

The periodic-Poisson kernel was the single largest accuracy limit on
the GR-domain tests, exactly as Finding 14.9 predicted.  Memory ceiling
in the sandbox is $L=192$ (doubled grid).


### 2026-05-21 - 15:08 — GR-3 cross-fork harness: all three Finding 14.5 fixes resolve the redshift, Fork C is the falsifier

Ran `ca-simulation/forks/gr3_fork_harness.py` over {baseline, Fork A
phase-tick, Fork B anisotropic, Fork C restricted-$c$} on one shared
open-BC potential ($L=128$, $M=1$, $\sigma=3$, $G_N=5\times10^{-4}$,
$c_0=0.5$). Headline:

| Fork | GR-1 $K$ | GR-2 | GR-3 ratio$_{GR}$ | GR-4 $\Delta\omega/\Delta\omega_\text{GR}$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **1.9991** | 2.0033 |
| Fork A | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **1.0001** | 2.0033 |
| Fork B | −3.8511 | 1.0018 | **1.0002** | 2.0033 |
| Fork C | −3.8495 | 1.0016 | **0.9998** | **1.0006** |

- **GR-3 (the target) is fixed by all three candidate forks** — the
  Pound–Rebka ratio drops from the baseline factor-2 (1.9991) to ≈1 in
  every fork. The factor-2 problem from Finding 14.5 is resolvable.
- **GR-1 and GR-2 are preserved** across all forks (photon sector
  untouched), so none of the fixes costs the deflection or Shapiro pass.
- **GR-4 Mercury is the discriminator.** Forks A and B are
  observationally degenerate with baseline ($\alpha_A=\alpha_B=1$);
  **Fork C predicts exactly half the perihelion advance**
  ($\alpha_A=\alpha_B=0.5$, $C/\text{baseline}=0.4995$). This is the
  experimentally falsifiable difference: a Mercury-class measurement at
  lattice precision would select Fork C (half advance) against A/B (full
  advance). Closed-form 1PN for C gives 0.5833 (with the
  $\alpha_A\alpha_B$ cross term) vs the integrated 0.4995 — caveat noted.
  Outputs in `test-results/gr3_fork_comparison.{json,md}`.

## 2026-05-22 - 13:42 — Real-space propagation demo + curl-residual geometry forks

**Goal.** Answer directly: (a) does a photon/fermion exist and *move across* the lattice, and (b) why does the composite-photon curl equation only close to $O(k)$? User proposed a fork test — working backwards from "$c_\text{lat}$ should be 1" — of whether simple-cubic geometry (instead of BCC) fixes both.

**Propagation demo** (`model-tests/run_propagation_demo.py`, results `test-results/propagation_demo_2026-05-22.json`, figure `test-results/figures/propagation_demo.png`). Three packets launched on a $64^3$ BCC lattice, group velocity read from the energy-density centroid over 44 ticks:

| Packet | measured $v_g$ | predicted | rel err |
|---|---|---|---|
| massless Weyl | 0.5752 | $1/\sqrt3$ | 0.37% |
| Dirac $m=0.3$ | 0.4667 | $d\omega/dk$ ($=0.81\,c_\text{lat}$) | 1.06% |
| composite photon | 0.5530 | $1/\sqrt3$ | 4.2% (finite-packet transverse-$k$ artifact) |

Momentum-space gates re-confirmed: transversality $4.6\times10^{-17}$, Poynting drift (with $c^2$, 200 steps) $4.8\times10^{-14}$. All three excitations traverse the lattice at $\approx c_\text{lat}$; the massive fermion is correctly subluminal. Method note: the Dirac packet must be seeded with the positive-energy 4-spinor eigenmode of $D_k$ (an $\eta$-only seed mixes $\pm$energy modes → zitterbewegung smears $v_g$ to 8.4% error). See `findings/F20-photon-fermion-propagation-demo.md`.

**Curl-residual geometry forks** (`ca-simulation/forks/curl_fork_{cubic,baseline_bcc,harness}.py`, results `test-results/curl_fork_results_2026-05-22.json`). Built a simple-cubic Weyl QCA fork ($c_\text{lat}=1$) and a BCC baseline fork on a common interface; harness measures $c_\text{lat}$, isotropy, curl-residual scaling, and doubler count. **Key result (F21):** the normalized curl residual is $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt2$ per unit $|k|$ on **every** geometry (BCC, simple-cubic, scaled-cubic $\alpha\in\{0.5,1,2\}$) to 6 figures. Cubic delivers $c_\text{lat}=1$ and marginally better isotropy, but the curl residual stays $O(k)$ (coefficient $1/\sqrt2$, worse than BCC's $1/\sqrt6$) **and** it reintroduces 8 Nielsen–Ninomiya fermion doublers vs the BCC single Weyl point. The earlier $1/\sqrt{2d}$ (Exactness #7) is the BCC special case of $c_\text{lat}/\sqrt2$. **Geometry is ruled out as the cause** of the $O(k)$ curl residual; it is intrinsic to the un-smeared pointwise bilinear. Next fork: Paper 1's smearing function $f_{\mathbf k}(\mathbf q)$, target = drive the coefficient to 0. Exactness Inventory: +1 Tier-1 (#49), now 50 exact algebraic results. See `findings/F21-curl-residual-geometry-independence.md`.

## 2026-05-23 - 16:35 — F28: F26 dispersion test against current LIV experiments

Wrote and ran `model-tests/test_F28_grb_dispersion.py`. Confronted F26's group-velocity
prediction ($v_g/c = 1 - \tfrac{1}{2}(E/E_\text{Planck})^2$) against best current
photon time-of-flight bounds (Fermi-LAT GRB 090510, LHAASO GRB 221009A, MAGIC Mrk 501).

**Verdict:** F26 is NOT excluded by any current experiment. The best constraint
(LHAASO GRB 221009A) is ~15 decades below the F26-predicted delay. Confirmation/
exclusion at the Planck-tick assumption requires ~$10^{20}$ eV photons from $z\sim 1$,
which is above the GZK cutoff — effectively unfalsifiable with photon TOF.

**Output:**
- `model-tests/test_F28_grb_dispersion.py` (script)
- `test-results/F28_grb_dispersion.json` (numerical results)
- `test-results/F28_grb_dispersion_summary.md` (markdown summary)
- `findings/F28-grb-dispersion-test.md` (formal finding)

**Side conclusion:** current LIV limits constrain the lattice tick duration to
$\tau_\text{lat} \lesssim 9 \times 10^{-37}$ s — i.e., anywhere between Planck time
and $\sim 10^7\,t_P$ is allowed. A scan over tick-rate values would convert the
current "untestable" verdict into a constraint on the lattice scale itself; that's
a cheap follow-up.

## 2026-05-24 - 00:00 — F37 chiral split propagation implemented

`w_propagation_step_spectral` in `ca_wmu.py` is now the chirally-faithful split-basis propagator from [F37](Findings/F37-rs-bcc-chirality-helicity.md), replacing the previous even-dispersion rotation. The $F^\pm = E_k \pm iB_k$ Riemann–Silberstein eigenstates advance independently at $\Omega^\pm(k)=2\omega_\pm(k/2)$ per tick; the old `_f26_rotation_step` (even average) is kept for the B-field propagator and massive-W path. A Nyquist-bin correction in `_chiral_dispersions` restores energy conservation to machine precision on even-length grids (without it, even-grid DFT aliasing broke $\Omega^+(−k)=\Omega^-(k)$ and leaked ~3–12 % energy per step via the IFFT `.real` truncation). New test `model-tests/test_F37_delta_omega.py` (5/5 PASS) verifies: (1) $F^+$ tracks $\Omega^+$ to $2.9\times10^{-14}$; (2) $F^-$ tracks $\Omega^-$ to $2.3\times10^{-14}$; (3) $\Delta\Omega = \Omega^+-\Omega^-$ along $(1,1,1)$ matches the [F30](Findings/F30-photon-dispersion-order-anisotropy-birefringence.md) exact value $-\sqrt3/27\,k^2$ to $3.95\times10^{-4}$ (coefficient fit) and $1.1\times10^{-14}$ (propagation residual); (4) energy conserved to $4.6\times10^{-14}$; (5) real-field structure preserved. Phase-2 regression remains 4/4.
